Excel 2010 crashes when I try to enter text into an imported report when recording a macro. Any idea why?

I have brought data in from another Access-based database.  The imported report looks fine, organizes and sorts without issues.  I need to do some analysis on this data, so I am trying to record a macro which will do some simple addition and display the totals at the bottom of the report.  But when I click on Record macro and try to enter any additional text into the report Excel immediately crashes as soon as I try to click out of the field I just entered data into. 

The Event Viewer shows an Event ID 1000 with the following text:

Faulting application name: EXCEL.EXE, version: 14.0.6126.5003, time stamp: 0x505b0834
Faulting module name: EXCEL.EXE, version: 14.0.6126.5003, time stamp: 0x505b0834

Faulting module path: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\EXCEL.EXE
Report Id: fdc44699-fdeb-11e2-a2cc-005056c00008

I posted this over at the MS Excel forums but got no response.  Any ideas why this might be occurring?

Have you reinstalled MS Office?

I had the same problem today. My coworker had the same problem as well with my file but no problem with a different file. I tried another file and it worked fine on my excel so it seems this issue is with the file and not excel. I have no idea why it happened but I didn't really have time to address the issue so I simply copied the code for renaming cells into a txt file so it could be easily copied into the macro editor when needed and just replace the column/row values and headlines. Problem "solved" - for now.
It takes a bit longer to record macros since you cant name anything during recording but doing it afterwards in the editor wasn't that much of a pain.

Tried running a repair but not a full reinstall.  After further testing I found it crashes on two different computers running Office 2010, so I think it's a bug in Excel.

Interesting... Try to save your file as .txt then import and see if your macro still crashes excel.  To me that'd be one way to test.

Doesn't crash when I do that.  Strange.  Here's the crash text, but haven't found anything useful relating to this problem online:

If it doesn't crash from a .txt it's something to do with the formatting bringing in from Access I believe.
