Excel crashes from using Combobox while implementing a "Google style search box"

I have been trying to implement a google style search box using the design demonstrated in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gm5m-y49rI0

However I have found that the line of VBA code:
    ComboBox1.FillListRange = "SearchResults"
Causes Excel to crash (not just a VBA error, but a hard Excel crash).

Here is a working demonstration: https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3e8u79tjz63t0z/ComboBoxCrashDemo.xlsm?dl=0

I was wondering if anyone knows of a work around for this? For now I am just going to use a different design that uses list validation instead of a ComboBox.
I also just wanted to let others know about this. I don't really know any good way to report these issues to MS, and I'm not confident that they care.

Hope [this](https://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/793769-combobox-selection-causing-excel-crash.html) helps.

I tried to replace using the FillListRange with using AddItem, Clear and RemoveItem, but I had a nightmare using Clear and RemoveItem since it would remove the current contents of the ComboBox.

I also tried using exactly the same Defined Name formula as shown in the video with no success.

I'm going to take a break from this for now. Using a design using data validation works very well and is almost as good.
