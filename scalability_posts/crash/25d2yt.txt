Looking for advanced crash courses to get me proficient in 2-3 weeks.

Could anyone recommend courses or places to go to for advanced learning? I took a course in the basics from tables to macros. Now, I'm starting an internship in 19 days and would really love to get my excel skills as high as possible to help the firm I will be working at. Thank you for any help. 

edit: i will obviously look through the recommendations on the sidebar. but just seeing if anyone has other good experience with rapid online courses.
