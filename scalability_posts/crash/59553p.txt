Error Message and Crash on Startup (Outlook 2016 - Mac)

My Excel crashed and now every time I open it up, I get the following message:


**Excel saved changes to the file before the application quit unexpectedly.**
*Do you want to open the last saved version of this file?*


If I choose OPEN, Excel immediately closes (no crash message or anything, it just quits.)

If I choose  CANCEL, Excel will take me to the new file page, however when I try to open up the file that was open when it crashed, it just closes Excel.

This happens every time. Even with a reboot. Any ideas on how to stop it?
