[VBA Help] Using .OpenCurrentDatabase leads to crash, help needed.

Hi guys. 

I work at a large commercial bank and I'm trying to automate one of our internal controls. This involves opening an Access database and running an Access module with Excel VBA. However, when I attempt to open my database (a .accdb file) via the .OpenCurrentDatabase command. It instantly crashes.

What's strange, though, is that if I use F8 to step through the module, it works perfectly fine. Also, one database that I use this exact same code on, works fine, but its a .mdb file. I've also tested it on a completely blank database and it still crashes. I'm at my wits end with this and I've tried everything I can think of. I'm sure its something simple but I can't, for the life of me, figure it out. Can anyone help?

Here is the exact code I'm running:

Dim AccessApp As Access.Application

Sub IRAQueries()
Set AcessApp = CreateObject(class:=Access.Application)
DoEvents
AccessApp.visible = true
AccessApp.OpenCurrentDatabase ("C:\Users\mylogin\desktop\myfile.accdb")
DoEvents
End Sub




Please help!!

Not sure if this is what's causing the problem but you spelled a variable name wrong:

Set AcessApp = ...

should be

Set AccessApp = ...

I'd use Option Explicit (By typing "option explicit" at the top of your modules) to disable implicit declaration. It's good practice not to use it anyway.

Other than that I can't seem to reproduce on my computer but I would ask what you need the DoEvents for as that might be where the problem is happening.

Well I don't know much about VBA with Microsoft Access but I'm pretty sure if you put 

     AccessApp.UserControl = True

after

    AccessApp.visible = true 

helps a few issues.

Sorry, I typed it out on mobile as reddit is blocked on my computer. I assure you the code is spelled correctly, as evidenced by the fact it runs fine when I step through it with F8. 

The DoEvents are just to try and make VBA wait until Access has completed its tasks, but they don't seem to make a difference. I've tried it with and without those lines.

I fear that its something inherent in our system, such as an encryption program or something like that. Its strange that it works with one of my databases but not with others. 

Anyways thank you so much for your response :)

Yeah, not sure really as I don't use much access. It's definitely very strange for it not to break on step through. 

Have you tried running it in a different environment, like you home computer?

This is probably a stupid idea, but you could try having your code wait in between the statements you currently have to see if it's an issue with not waiting for some system response.
