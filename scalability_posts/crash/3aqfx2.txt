When people ask you to give them a crash course in excel what do you teach them?

For example, my present situation is a gf with basic knowledge, but once past the most basic of formulas she knows nothing. She has an interview coming up soon that requires excel however and I don't know where to start on teaching her the basics, and at least if not this time but help her for the next interview she gets. 

I'd call myself very advanced so I'd worry that some stuff I know and use wouldn't be required for what she is going for and I'd worry I'd skip over something basic that I just assume. 

I'm guessing a lot of people on here would get asked this sort of thing a lot so what's your go to?

I'm an IT trainer, and I'll give you a bit of an idea what we cover in our 3 levels of Excel courses.

BEGINNER:


Excel basics (where things are, what they're called)

Formatting

Basic calculations

AutoFill (including custom lists, though I get the idea not a lot of people use this)

Basic Calculations

Absolute cell referencing

AutoSum

Printing

INTERMEDIATE:


IF functions

Date and Time calculations

Calculations with percentages

Charts

Protection

Data lists (sorting, filtering, subtotals)

Calculations across workbooks

Conditional Formatting

ADVANCED:


Advanced IFs (including nested IFs, IFs with AND and OR)

SUMIF, COUNTIF, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS

IFERROR

What if analysis (scenarios, goal seek, solver, data tables)

Macros

Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

Data Validation

VLOOKUPS

INDEX and MATCH (only briefly covered)


Having said that, it's all very well and good knowing Pivot Tables and Macros but without some of the more basic stuff, it'll look a bit weird. 

I'd start off with a bit of navigating and selecting (include a bunch of kb shortcuts, because they're impressive), AutoSum for sure (including using it when your data is in different layouts), then move onto some other basic functions like AVERAGE and MIN/MAX. Absolute cell referencing you could always come back to, but it really is quite important. Charts (F11 key is a godsend), basic sorting and filtering, and VLOOKUPS and Pivots. When doing functions, don't forget about the insert function dialogue box, because it's great for beginners. 

If you have time, data validation is pretty impressive, as is protection (as in actually protecting worksheets, rather than using password protection on the whole file). 

Hope this helps! I've actually got tons of demo files if you want any of those too! :) 

Edited for formatting.

Edit 2: I will sort demo files for those who have asked when I'm home from work this evening :-) 

Edit 3: Links sent to files, guys. Let me know if you have any questions about them! 
-------------
I would also show her how to navigate/highlight/copy/cut/paste/etc. with control keys rather than scrolling and dragging. 
-------------
I suppose it depends on how soon the interview is coming up, but I'd be sure to at least try to get her comfortable with vlookup and pivot tables.

Depending on the type of job just reviewing some of the basic formulas she may not know would be valuable for parsing stuff to pivot... Like date and time functions, upper/lower, etc. And conditional formatting of course.

If time allows then index/match, array functions, and connecting to other data sources would be pretty high on the list too.
-------------
I now tell them to go to HR and book a course \^^

But in the past I showed them some basic stuff like

Filters
Changing formats
Conditional (High/Low values/ Duplicates)

for Formulae

SUM/SUMIF/SUMIFS

COUNT/COUNTIF/COUNTIFS
And explain Average as the syntax is practically the same.

IF

AND/OR

MAX/MIN

VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP

Then if there is time 

PIVOTS

LEN/LEFT/RIGHT/TRIM/VALUE/TEXT/UPPER/PROPER

IFERROR/IFNA/ISBLANK/ISNUMBER/ISTEXT etc

& instead of CONCATENATE

INDEX/MATCH

INDIRECT

Workbook protection

Then if they want to die of boredome (or havent already done so)

Arrays, Macros, Data connections,

wow, no one is saying anything about sumproducts?

they are fantastic and I use them literally every day at work. My list would look like this:

* vlookup

* Sumproduct

* If

* Pivot tables

* how to properly use absolute references

I save tons of time with short cuts. I usually try to teach people to use ctrl+arrows to get to the beginning or end of their data. I also use ctrl+h replace and replace all. 

All of the other basics are covered in other comments. 
-------------
Just as a note, my experience was that pivot tables and charts were a little hard to get used to in a short space of time. Learning pivots is easy (the drag and drop part) but understanding why and when to use it takes time practising with lots and lots of data.

I suppose the most snazzy thing these days is plugging user generated Excel cells via validated lists into raw text for microsoft word.

A whole new CV at the click of a button? 

Sourced from a master database of all your work history and academic achievements so you don't have to repeat yourself when typing anything?

Add that to themes and styles and who needs to write anything in a CV ever again?

Why not...
-------------
In my opinion, the strongest tool is the macro recorder.
Pairing that with the basic ability to change snippets of what you record can let you do almost anything. And using it builds a familiarity with VBA.

You can just kinda play around with it and copy paste bits of what you need. All you really need to know is how to identify which actions created which line of code. Maybe change around the ranges a bit too.
-------------
Rule number one: never put text and numbers in the same cell
-------------
What to teach depends on what the other person wants to do. If all they want is sorting lists/tables, then formulas are mostly irrelevant, and formatting, sorting and filters are key. OTOH, if they want to calculate mortgage amortization tables, formulas are more important than any ribbon commands.
-------------
PivotTables are definitely useful but I haven't used them nearly as often as the other things you mentioned.  To add to your list (maybe more intermediate level):

* Column filtering (not tables)
* Turning off auto-calculate and using F9
* Turning off gridlines rather than making white borders (ಠ_ಠ)
* Using F4 for fixed cell references
* Organizing data vertically rather than horizontally (ﾉ｀Д´)ﾉ
-------------
Came here to check someone said; IF, VLOOKUP and PivotTables

Not disappointed
-------------
Thanks! Forgot on mobile
-------------
I would not consider SUMIF appropriate, I would leave COUNTIF for maybe session 2, and I would consider adding boolean (OR, AND) operators.
-------------
Offset (match are a good replacement for vlookup.
-------------
Usually all they want to know is the Vlookup.
-------------
Any chance I could get you to share some of those demo files?
-------------
Can you share your demo files?

Thank you.
-------------
Can I partake of said demo files?
-------------
Wouldn't mind some demo files! Always looking to learn/seek better ways of office productivity 
-------------
Well, since you're sorting them anyway, I would love to get in on that, too. Please and thanks.
-------------
Could I have your demo files also? Many thanks!
-------------
Are you still sharing your demo files? I would love to check them out. Thank you so much!

First interview is Wednesday so I have this evening and tomorrow after work so time is quite tight. It's only first round interview so I'm going with the thought if she knows the basics in that I can get her up to speed in other areas between now and a possible second round. 

Hopefully even if she realises she's out of her depth and she doesn't get this one there will be more chances on the horizon! 
-------------
shortcuts although handy come with time though, if i drop a page of key shortcuts on her lap i doubt there'd be time for anything else!
-------------
Yeah the dragging dropping would at least make her look good, i'm still amazed that so many people in work here don't know even that kinda stuff.
-------------
Whoa! What you're listing out are advanced stuff, not for some beginner looking for a quick intro into Excel. 
-------------
I used to use/create/maintain something like that but for HTML pages. Basically a front end in Excel with requesting the needed data and it would output valid HTML/CSS. Very slick.
-------------
with things like that though that can be taught further down the line, Its crazy powerful but very easy to mess something up like if you used it to go to end of list then it would remember the cell reference and not the command to get there
-------------
I find your last four points to cause confusion at times.

> Turns calcs off and never turns them back on. Asks why they don't work. Stupid man telling me stupid things
 
> Turns gridlines back on and complains they don't print

> Fixes cell references constantly and then manually changes the cell references instead of using relative

> Does everything vertically. Even when not appropriate.

These are actual problems I've had to deal with.
-------------
Second on the UX and formatting elements.  While functions are important, often the real shortcomings in uninitiated excel users can be ability to format, navigate/organize data efficiently. 

Of course depends on the application. 

For financial modeling, covering Goal Seek would be beneficial as well. 
-------------
Those three (and variations) are pretty much all you need to do with excel for most functions. 
-------------
In terms of importance: Pivot, vlookup, if, countif.


Also, filtering. Maybe how to record a macro too.
-------------
I don't know, I use SUMIF and COUNTIF a lot, although I would just skip to SUMIFS and COUNTIFS instead. Totally agree about the boolean operators though.
-------------
INDEX MATCH would be a good replacement for VLOOKUP but I don't think a crash course would cover OFFSET
-------------
You do that and you're "hot shit in Excel!!"
-------------
Not OP, but if you're looking for some training documents, [here's a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/3a5nw5/looking_to_teach_an_excel_lunchandlearn_use_my/) I made the other day with some training documents you may enjoy!
-------------
Me too please!

Two days won't be enough. You can and absolutely should cover the topics that /u/TheCryptic suggested, but your tightest resource isn't so much the limited time, but the "information soak delay" coupled with capacity for focus. 

If you can sit down for more than an hour and a half, and she retains the general knowledge presented I'd say you're doing better than average. But if there's any sort of skill test it has a high chance of falling short. Practice is going to be very necessary.

I don't mean to be a downer, but my experience tells me that, while this is absolutely a worthwhile effort and you guys should be doing this if she has any inclination to work in an office environment, you'd need to get very lucky for this to work out.

If there isn't a practical skill test or a verbal quiz, or an explanation of an example of the skill, then you've got a good chance as long as she sounds confident and all else is acceptable.

And if she does get it, continue the crash courses! Find out the types of tasks she will need to be doing so she can practice them with you. Practice practice practice.

I don't know if it's enough time but udemy has a sort of crash course for excel as well. Might come in handy.

https://www.udemy.com/tutorials/learn-excel/
-------------
haha yes of course. well when I first used excel, I used it pretty much as microsoft word. Only when I realised I knew what it could do, I was like "why on earth did I not know this stuff before". People who dont care to learn I think just dont know what it is capable of.
-------------
Whoops! Thanks for calling me out. Not sure what I was thinking. :p
-------------
* Which is why "turning off calculations" and "pressing F9" needs to be in the same sentence.
* Who the fuck prints gridlines?  Unless you're trying to make graph paper of course.
* That's just plain stupid.
* Yeah, that can be annoying too.  I only mention it because I took over a report someone else made and they organized most of the data horizontally and I was going out to 3-letter columns.  That spreadsheet could've been a perfect "case study" on how NOT to use Excel efficiently.

-------------
I guess it depends on the definition of "crash course." They're both extremely useful... But it might takes a little foundation building to get there. 
-------------
I would agree.  I taught several colleagues how to use index, match, and offset in a training session dedicated to just those three functions.  These weren't Excel beginners though.
-------------
Crazy right? 
-------------
Yeah i think most people in here use excel for graphs and thats it. One guy took over a process when someone was off sick. The workbook was empty of formulas, each formula she done manually, every week. after we looked at it 4 hours of work became a matter of minutes
