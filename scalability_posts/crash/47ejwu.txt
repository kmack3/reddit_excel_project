Excel crashes when I try to add a worksheet

I have a spreadsheet I use to prepare construction estimates that looks up material and labor prices from another spreadsheet.  The formula for this lookup has been the same for almost 5 years.   I created a new estimate and tried to copy a worksheet into the same book and Excel crashed.  I tried copying it into another book and it crashed.  I am using Excel 2013.
