crash

Macro executes when stepped through with F8 but causes a crash when called by an event.

(This is Powerpoint not Excel but the VBA should be the same so hopefully someone can help me.)

I have a messy piece of code that I've pieced together from a few sources online that is supposed to update and restart a continuous presentation whenever a master file on the network is updated. It checks the file modification dates at the end of each presentation and if the master is newer it opens it, copies all the slides, closes it, pastes the slides into the presentation, saves itself and restarts.

This works fine when I step through it, but when I try to run it from the presentation it crashes Powerpoint somewhere around the paste step. If I recover the document it has been updated. Here's the error information:

My code is:

    Sub OnSlideShowPageChange(ByVal SSW As SlideShowWindow)
        If SSW.View.CurrentShowPosition = SSW.Presentation.SlideShowSettings.EndingSlide Then

        
            Call update
        
        End If
    End Sub

    Sub update()
            Dim oFS As Object
            Dim strFilename As String

            strFilename = "c:\filepath\master.pptm"

            Set oFS = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
        
            ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
            Dim oFSLocal As Object
            Dim strFilenameLocal As String

            strFilenameLocal = "c:\filepath\slave.pptm"

            Set oFSLocal = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
        
            ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
            If oFS.GetFile(strFilename).DateLastModified > oFSLocal.GetFile(strFilenameLocal).DateLastModified Then
            
                ActivePresentation.Slides.Range.Delete
            
                Presentations.Open FileName:="c:\filepath\master.pptm", ReadOnly:=msoFalse
            
                ActivePresentation.Slides.Range.Copy
            
                With Application.Presentations("master.pptm")
                    .Close
                End With
            
                Application.Presentations(1).Windows(1).Activate
                  
                ActivePresentation.Slides.Paste
            
                Application.ActivePresentation.Save
            
                ActivePresentation.SlideShowSettings.Run

            End If
    End Sub

The main part of the code is wrapped in a function so I can step through it, it won't be in there for the final product. Does anyone see what's going wrong? I've tried adding waits, message boxes and doevents, none of which help.


-------------
I've had this happen a lot with copy/paste operations.  My best guess is that Excel isn't done copying the content by the time Paste is called.

After your Copy statement, put in a call to Wait.

    Application.Wait Now + #12:00:01 AM#
-------------
It's really weird, when I put that in it prevents anything from executing.

Edit: When I step through it highlights .Wait and says "Compile Error: Method or data member not found". Do I need to initialize some library?
-------------
Seems like a PPT macro doesn't have it...  Quick google search got me here:  https://www.office-forums.com/threads/vba-application-wait.455032/

    Sub Wait()
      waitTime = 5
      Start = Timer
      While Timer < Start + waitTime
         DoEvents
      Wend
    End Sub

Apparently this will wait for 5 secs.  EDIT:  obviously, you should set your macro to wait for just one second not 5.
-------------
Ok that works to insert a pause but it still crashes.
-------------
Just to confirm, set the timer to take 5 seconds.  Confirm that the macro actually takes 5 seconds longer to run (to be sure that the delay is working as expected.)
-------------
Yes, there's a visible 5 second pause after the master document closes. Then the paste seems to work, the save works and as the show restarts PowerPoint crashes.
-------------
I added in a few more waits and it seems pretty clear that it's crashing as the code ends.
-------------
Hm, ok.  I figured the issue was related to the copy/paste, but I guess it's with the slideshow.  You say you've tried waits in the OP, but - if you haven't yet - stick that Wait sub right after the save and before running the Show.
-------------
Alright, well...  I tried.  I can keep throwing out ideas, but none would be based on experience.  Never coded for PPT before.

My last guess:  is it possible PPT doesn't like starting a new presentation if one is already running?  Maybe when you step through the code it closes the presentation, so the error doesn't occur?  You can try ending the original presentation before starting the new one.
-------------
Figured I'd let you know in case it's ever relevant (plus I hate finding help threads where the person says solved but never explains the solution). Apparently the OnSlideShowPageChange event is no longer supported and simply doesn't work, in any circumstances. Since there are no other readily accessible events to fire the macro I had to add a class module that gets initialized and then fires on slide show end, which adds an annoying flicker to the desktop when it restarts but at least it works. Thanks for the help, you put me on the right path to fixing this.
-------------
Ok thanks for the help. That's a good idea, I'll see if I can figure out how to do that.
