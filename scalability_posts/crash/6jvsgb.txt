PP crash when I click update links to connected Excel Charts

Can someone help? If I open PP and say update all links, it crashes. If i go into PP without updating and manually update links, it update each chart with no problem. Is there another way to have charts linked in PP? I do not know much about VBA, if you can help please. Thank you.

For those wondering PP is Power Point... 

OP it would probably help if you used whole words and not abbreviations in the post title and post.
