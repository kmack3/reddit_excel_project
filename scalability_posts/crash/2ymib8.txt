[Google Sheets] Can a google sheet crash if there are too many functions on it?

Is it possible? 


-------------
I think there is a row/sheet limit so in theory there is a content threshold. 

From experience I've noticed that it can get super buggy after the file gets too many sheets added to it. No exact number to report but I've certainly seen it get bogged down.
