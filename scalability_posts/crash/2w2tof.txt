Excel crashes every time I run this VBA macro to copy / paste every 2nd row in Excel. Any ideas why?

Hi,

So I am running a macro to copy every other row in one worksheet and pasting into another. The original macro was used to copy / paste a specific cell in a column. I altered the macro to copy / paste the whole row. Now every time I run the macro the program crashes. Can anyone tell me what the problem might be? Here's the code; 

Sub copyTrackOutData()
Dim rp1 As Worksheet
Dim tod1 As Worksheet
Dim lngRowCounter As Long
Dim lngRowMultiplier As Long

lngRowCounter = 2
lngRowMultiplier = 1

Set rp1 = Worksheets("Report")
Set tod1 = Worksheets("Track Out Data")

Do While Not IsEmpty(rp1.Range("A2: O2" & lngRowCounter))
    tod1.Range("A2:O2" & lngRowCounter * lngRowMultiplier).Value = rp1.Range("A2: O2" & lngRowCounter).Value
    lngRowCounter = lngRowCounter + 1
Loop
End Sub

Thanks!

At quick glance it looks like it is crashing because it is an infinite loop, in that the range you are looking in will almost never be empty...

So if I am following your code correctly, you are saying to LOOP until range A2:O21 (22, 23, 24) is empty.  Well if you have any thing at all A2, A3, F4... it will loop forever.

I am curious as to why you are lngRowCounter?

I am also guessing that you are multiplying the values on "Report" by 1 to store them numbers? Could you please explain your lngRowMultiplier?

It appears you just want to copy a range if the range has data? is that correct?

I will test to see if I can find anything, but below is for formatting only:

    Sub copyTrackOutData()
    
    
    Dim rp1 As Worksheet
    Dim tod1 As Worksheet
    Dim lngRowCounter As Long, lngRowMultiplier As Long
     lngRowCounter = 2
     lngRowMultiplier = 1
    
        Set rp1 = Worksheets("Report")
        Set tod1 = Worksheets("Track Out Data")
    
        Do While Not IsEmpty(rp1.Range("A2: O2" & lngRowCounter))
            tod1.Range("A2:O2" & lngRowCounter * lngRowMultiplier).Value = rp1.Range("A2: O2" & lngRowCounter).Value
            lngRowCounter = lngRowCounter + 1
        Loop
    
    End Sub
-------------
Yes, I am trying just to copy a range of data. There is no specific reason for using lngRowCounter. How do I stop this from looping infinitely, do I just add a lngLastRow variable?
-------------
Thank you, I couldn't figure out how to format this properly. 
-------------
I looks like you are trying to use some sort of criteria to decide if you should copy the range or not, is this still true? or do you want to append the data to the bottom of the Track Out Date sheet?

A simple range copy would be:

         lngLstRowR = Sheets("Report").UsedRange.Rows.Count    
         Range("A2:O" & lngLstRowR).Copy Destination:=Sheets("Track Out Data").Range("A2:A" & lngLstRowR)

Bascilly looking for the last row on the Report sheet, and copy'n the data from one place to the next, but I am guessing that you want this a bit more dynamic since you are trying to use a loop...
-------------
You need to put four spaces in front of each line for it to format as code.  The easy way to do that is to take your code in your VBA editor, highlight it, and hit Tab to indent everything.
-------------
I'm not looking for any specific criteria, I have my data organized enough to the point where I just need to cut and paste every other row into the new worksheet. So I'm trying to build a macro that will start on row 3, cut row 3 and paste it into row 2 in a new workbook, then cut row 5, paste it into row 3 in new workbook, so on and so forth until I reach the last row. 

Edit- changed copy / paste to cut / paste
-------------
Okay give this a whirl:

***Also, please back up your workbook before running this macro...***

    Option Explicit
    
    Sub Testing()
    
    Dim rngCell As Range
    Dim lngLstRow As Long, lngI As Long
    
    lngLstRow = Sheets("Report").UsedRange.Rows.Count
    
    For lngI = 3 To lngLstRow Step 2
        Range("A" & lngI & ":O" & lngI).Copy Destination:=Sheets("Track Out Data").Range("A65536").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0)
    Next lngI
    
    End Sub

So here is what we are doing.

First we need to find the last row on the Report sheet:

     lngLstRow = Sheets("Report").UsedRange.Rows.Count

Then we are going to just loop though the sheet, starting on the 3 row, and skipping every other row to copy and paste to the bottom of the Track out Data sheet:


     Range("A" & lngI & ":O" & lngI).Copy Destination:=Sheets("Track Out Data").Range("A65536").End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0)

That is about it... let me know if that works...
-------------
The code works thanks! I changed the 'copy' to 'cut', one more thing how do I delete the empty rows that I cut the data from?
-------------
Never mind I figured out the answer to my last question, thank you. 
-------------
Solution verified
-------------
Change the 

    For lngI = 3 To lngLstRow Step 2
to   

    For lngI = lngLstRow to 3 Step -2

Looping backwards through the range makes it so delete row commands don't mess up the loop.  Then just use entirerow.delete.  I am not sure if .cut and .insert will work to remove the original row (like it does in standard excel), but it might be worth a shot instead.

Just make sure lngLstRow is odd and contains a row you want moved.

Great, glad you got it working!
