Running a macro to sort works but afterwards, saving crashes Excel

(Excel 2010) On a roster spreadsheet with multiple tabs of no more than 100 people each, I have a macro to run a custom sort tied to a button. The macro works, but once it runs, if I later save, excel crashes, saying there is unreadable content. Any ideas? My VBA knowledge is limited pretty much to frankensteining code I find online together to make things work. Any thoughts?

Sub SortRank()

Dim xlSort As XlSortOrder
Dim LastRow As Long
Dim sCustomList(1 To 18) As String

sCustomList(1) = "Maj"
sCustomList(2) = "Capt"
sCustomList(3) = "1stLt"
sCustomList(4) = "1st Lt"
sCustomList(5) = "2ndLt"
sCustomList(6) = "2nd Lt"
sCustomList(7) = "CWO"
sCustomList(8) = " WO"
sCustomList(9) = "MGySgt"
sCustomList(10) = "1stSgt"
sCustomList(11) = "MSgt"
sCustomList(12) = "GySgt"
sCustomList(13) = "SSgt"
sCustomList(14) = "Sgt"
sCustomList(15) = "Cpl"
sCustomList(16) = "LCpl"
sCustomList(17) = "PFC"
sCustomList(18) = "Pvt"

With ActiveSheet
Application.AddCustomList ListArray:=sCustomList

        LastRow = .Cells(.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row

         If (.Range("A9").Value > .Range("A" & CStr(LastRow))) Then
             xlSort = xlAscending
         Else
             xlSort = xlDescending
         End If
         
         .Range("A8:PR" & LastRow).Sort Key1:=.Range("A8"), Order1:=xlSort, Header:=xlYes, _
            OrderCustom:=Application.CustomListCount + 1, MatchCase:=False, Orientation:=xlTopToBottom, _
            DataOption1:=xlSortNormal
     End With
     
If Application.CustomListCount > 4 Then
         Application.DeleteCustomList (Application.CustomListCount)
     End If

End Sub






-------------
Is there any other code in your workbook? Is it just the sort macro or is there anything in the Worksheet or Workbook module?

No it's only the single module
