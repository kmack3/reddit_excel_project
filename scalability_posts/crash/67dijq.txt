Excel iOS crashes with opening from Dropbox

Is anyone else having issues on iOS with Excel crashing while trying to load a file, or shortly thereafter, particularly when trying to open files that are shared with Dropbox, or opening as read only, as if someone else has the file open?

None of my non-iOS users seem to be experiencing this.

Just worked with my wife yesterday. Opening on IOS from Dropbox opened her document in read-only. I told her to stop using Dropbox since we pay for OneDrive and get so much free space. 

Saving on OneDrive and editing from there resolved all the issues with read-only files. 

So, yes confirmed.
