Excel 2016: deleting worksheets with slicers causes crash. Anyone else see this?

I've been wrestling with my new version of Excel that has been crashing on macros that worked fine on the 2010 version.    With much troubleshooting, I have figured out why:   my pivot table worksheet has slicers on it, and when deleting the sheet it crashes.   If I inhibit the creation of the slicers and then delete the sheet, it works fine.

Has anyone else seen this with Excel 2016?   Can I get some confirmation that it's an Excel issue, rather than my workstation?

Thanks!

Yes I have experienced it, I just isolated a "crash on sheet delete with VBA" problem to the presence of slicers on the sheet.  (That is how I found your post.)
Running: WIN 10 and Excel 2016.
Failure is with code that worked in previous versions of Excel.
Bad news is that deleting Slicers in VBA looks like a nightmare! Meaning no workaround except manual deletion.
-------------
I've found that if you insert code that deletes the slicers before the sheet is deleted, it works fine.   Let me know if you find something different.

Deleting the slicers looked like more than I wanted to do at the moment - last time I looked slicers seemed to have an odd implementation. If I remember correctly, a slicer can be used on multiple sheets?
Was it complicated?

Didn't seem that difficult to me.    After making a pivot table on a worksheet, here is the code to add a slicer (for a *pivot table* variable called "Sample Number").

---

ActiveWorkbook.SlicerCaches.Add(ActiveSheet.PivotTables("PivotTable1"), _
    "Sample Number").Slicers.Add ActiveSheet, , "Sample Number", "Sample Number", _
    10, 710, 144, 150  
ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array("Sample Number")).Select

---

Here's the code to delete it:

---
Dim shp as Shape  

For Each shp In Sheets("Analysis Table").Shapes  
       If shp.Type = msoSlicer Then shp.Delete  
Next shp

Thanks for the code!  When I get a few minutes I'll see if I can use it, or a variation, in my project.

Thanks! This was driving me nuts! It worked.

Duuuuude! Thank you so much. I've been banging my head against my desk for the past three days trying to figure this out. We just switched from windows 8 to windows 10 and my code starting acting up for some reason only on the new computers. This definitely fixed it, thanks again!
