[Excel 2013-W10] If I print something in excel through the file->print tab dialog and scroll soon after clicking the print button...excel crashes. Am I the only one??

Just type something, click file in the top left, click print tab, click print button, and start scrolling. See if your excel crashes.

Seriously? I don't have another machine to try this out, but I feel like I'm going crazy here. Is this a known bug? Is there any way to fix it?

Thanks for replies in advance!

edit: scrolling using a mouse wheel if that is significant.

Very likely that it's your razer mouse driver.
