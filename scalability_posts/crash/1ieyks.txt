Excel OSX 2008 Crashes every time I close a specific spreadsheet

Was wondering if I could get any help here. I have a specific spreadsheet (.xls) that causes the program to crash every time I close it. However, for whatever reason, excel insists on opening it every time I open excel. 

I've tried: 

* saving it into other excel formats (file not saved error)

*  hitting escape when excel boots up (crashes)

* ignoring it (It's really annoying)

Any way I can remove it from a startup folder or something? Google told me to look for an "XLstart" folder but I can't find it. Hunting through my applications --> office 2008 --> office --> startup --> excel is empty. 

Any ideas?
