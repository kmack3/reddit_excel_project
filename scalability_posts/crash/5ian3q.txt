user form causes charts to crash excel

I have a workbook with two sheets containing embedded charts. I recently added a user form that functions as a password prompt to quickly protect all sheets in a workbook with a single click and a password. Now the weird thing is that after I added this VBA and user form I can no longer view either of the embedded charts because excel will crash instantly with no error message when I attempt to view them. I get the below event viewer error every time the crash occurs and cannot for the life of me figure out what is happening. Can anyone help?

    Faulting application name: EXCEL.EXE, version: 16.0.4456.1003, time stamp: 0x58139fca
    Faulting module name: chart.dll, version: 16.0.4471.1000, time stamp: 0x582b2d03
    Exception code: 0xc0000005
    Fault offset: 0x00000000001033eb
    Faulting process id: 0x2028
    Faulting application start time: 0x01d2560f05ff050a
    Faulting application path: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office16\EXCEL.EXE

I cannot upload to dropbox or google drive from my work system due to network restrictions. If someone knows a good place I can upload a spreadsheet I will provide it for troubleshooting.


-------------
Figured out the issue, somehow the charts properties got set to:

>ProtectData: True
>ProtectFormatting: True
>ProtectSelection: True

but all the variables displayed false so they got into a mixed state of settings where they were set to true but displayed false. Toggled the settings on then off again and everything works fine now.
