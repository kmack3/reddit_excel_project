crash

Been editing and updating the same spreadsheet every day for over a year. Now suddenly any time I delete cells (with delete button, not key) or select and drag a group of cells, Excel crashes. Even copying data to new file causes crashes. Is there a way to track down the problem?

Basically for about the last year and a half, I take the previous day's spreadsheet, add data to the bottom, reference the old data, then delete that old data and work on today's data. I have a ton of conditional formatting in a few columns and there are multiple sheets in the worksheet.

This week, whenever I try to delete a blank row, or delete yesterday's data, or select a few cells and drag them to a new place, or try to subtotal some stuff, *or do any of these things in a brand new sheet I've copied the data into*, Excel crashes. 

I've learned to save constantly and just use the delete key to remove data (leaving blank holes), but that's no way to live.

Is there any way to track down what's causing the crashes?


-------------
I am guessing the constant insert/delete on the file has fragmented the conditional formatting rules. These tend to really tax Excel and since you have a ton of them, there's where I would start. Check your rules and see how many there are. Chances are the same rule has been broken up into duplicates that point to different ranges. If you see a lot of duplicated rules, create a test copy of the file and delete all conditional formatting and see if the crashes stop.  
If so, fix the conditional formatting in your file. remove the duplicates and correct the ranges of the remaining 'master' rule. 
See if that helps.
