Big ask for help with a Ping Pong ladder

At the moment I do not have anything created, which contributes to this being a big ask for help. However I thought it might be the sort of thing someone has made before and may be able to share.
What I'd love is a table tennis ladder for my office in excel. The way it would work is that your rank would be adjusted depending on who you played. So if you were rank 10 and beat rank 9 then you'd become rank 9. However if you are rank 10 and beat rank 1 then you'd become rank 5. So it basically takes your 2 ranks at the start of playing and then changes it to the rounded down average. This is easy enough to do manually, but it'd be great to have it automated... something I think may involve macros? So on tab 1 you have a table. On tab 2 then you input a result and set a macro running. This would copy the result in tab 2 to tab 3 and update the table based on the outcome. Added to this it'd be good to have stats for wins and losses, but I can probably do that as a secondary table by just reading data.
As I said this is a big ask. But if anyone could create such a macro it'd be very helpful.


-------------
I'd look around a bit. Unless you want to make it yourself as a personal challenge, there's probably 100 versions of league ladders already made.

I am traveling today but if you still need something by tomorrow, I'll give it a go, I seem to think I did something like this, or modified another ladder workbook for someone recently but will have to look thru my files.
-------------
you could automate it - one tab is the current ladder result, the 2nd is the results table

results table: name, rank played, name, rank, winner, name, INT(AVERAGE(rank cols)




-------------
I did google a bit but couldn't find anything ready made. Unfortunately I've never created macros before so it's a bit beyond me. Good learning experience I know, but would take me a long time to do. So thought I'd have a go at seeing if anyone here had anything
-------------
If you get any time that'd be amazing. I now have a file mocked up for how I'd like it to look as well as an equation for the ranking. I live in Australia, so apologies if it takes me time to reply. Timezone Hoohahs and stuff

I may play around with this. I am not sure it'll work though because it needs to update with each new game played, which is why I thought a Macro was the way
