How to calculate hourly rate & overtime when rate is based on what time the work was performed, not for how long.

Hello /r/excel ! I am a Beginner/Intermediate Excel user on the 2003 platform in Windows.  I am trying to create a time sheet for recording a Technician's time on site by inputting their time in and time out.

The fun part is that my company bills at different rates depending on the time of day.  We bill at $115/hr from 0700 to 1800 and $172.50 from 1800 to 0700.  I just need daily totals and will total for the week with a =SUM formula.

I am trying to think of a way to do it with formulas, but can't think of a way to capture the cost reliably.

As long as your start time was always the lowest number of the day (i.e., your times didn't roll through midnight) then this might work.  Note I listed times as numbers (i.e. '700', '1800', etc.), not as times.  
D1=700 (starting time of regular pay)  
E1=1800 (ending time of regular pay)  
B3:C3 - start and end time  


    =IF(B3<D1,(D1-B3)/100,0)+IF(C3>E1,(C3-E1)/100,0)  
  
This will give you the number of hours of overtime.

Here's how I'd do it (A2 = $115, B2 = start_time, C2 = end_time):

    =A2/100*(if(B2>C2,C2+2400,C2)-B2+1/2*max(0,700-B2)+1/2*max(0,if(B2>C2,C2+2400,C2)-max(B2,1800)))
