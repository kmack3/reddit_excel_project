Filter conditional formatting of large data

Excel have over 1 million rows, but can't even handle to filter 100,000 rows with 1 conditional formatting. It stuck. Any better idea (other than vba)?


-------------
Create a helper column with the same conditional format logic and filter on the helper value.
-------------
What are you ultimately trying to do? I feel like there has to be a better tool than Excel for whatever it is you are doing. Are you really able to analyse 1m rows of data at a time anyway?
-------------
but still weird that excel limit simple and useful function. At first I thought its my laptop problem. But, when I use better workstation at workplace, same problem, so, it can't be computer problem.
-------------
ultimately, I am trying to filter 100,000 rows of data (which column have conditional formatting).
-------------
I don't think they limit it as much as the mechanisms available do not allow useful interaction with 100s of thousands of rows.. for any function...
-------------
What is the conditional formatting for? Is it required, or could you filter some other way?

Power pivot will deal with those amounts of data easily, but can't directly detect formatting I think
-------------
I have more than 100k row (not so big i think).Put it this way. ID should be 1-100k. But, total of row is more than 100k, let say 100,100 rows. So, 100 duplicates. So I conditional formatting to find duplicate, and filter by color of conditional formatting.
**I have to eyeball the duplicate, to choose ID with better/relevant info.
**I dont think my data so big, (100k). Thats why from beginning I thought maybe my old laptop can't handle it.

Download power query, and then:
