[X-POST] Large excel document makes the computer very slow, what to do?

I have an excel document with like 20 sheets, some of which have like 5,000 rows and 200 columns. There are also like 100 macros, many of which pull data from Bloomberg API. My whole computer is extremely slow because of this and sometimes crashes which is bad because I use the excel document professionally. Are there any libraries/solution/modules/software that is built for this kind of purpose?

Is your code full of `Activate`s and `Select`ing?

Have you got, towards the top of the main program,  `Application.ScreenUpdating = False`?

Are you using Volatile functions like `OFFSET`, `INDIRECT` or unnecessarily referencing whole columns (`A:A`) instead of the actual used range?

Do you use Array Formula?

What version of Excel are you using?

But in all seriousness it sounds like you're outgrowing excel and may need to look into more powerful tools.

You should def. be looking into optimizing what you are doing. Sloopy macros are fine when you are small, but bring oyu into big trouble on bigger work.

Also you should try turning off automatic calculation. You can refresh by F9 and via macro if needed. That usually speeds things up again.

Also you should be looking ar your process about pulling the data and processing it and optimize there.

IMO we can't diagnose the issue based on the description and no code to view.

What other tools are there?

If you are already comfortable with Excel, you should graduate to the Power Pivot model and possibly Power BI.  They will both seem familiar to you if you are comfortable with Excel. They are also incredibly powerful modeling tools and even have a baked in ETL called Power Query that might help you initially to avoid needing a database to manage data. This is the future direction for Microsoft and the tools are only getting better.  I am a consultant in the BI field. I love (for the most part) these tools. Hope they can help make your life a bit easier.  [Primer here](https://powerpivotpro.com/what-is-power-pivot/).
