Spreadsheet accumulates shapes and causes the spreadsheet become unnecessarily large

Excel 2010

Their task is copying and pasting info from one spreadsheet to another. This causes hidden boxes to accumulate in the spreadsheet they use, which makes the spreadsheet balloon in size. One is currently about 8mb. I usually use the delete shapes from worksheet vb code to get rid of the boxes, but this sometimes takes a long time. Is there a way to prevent these shapes from even showing up?

Paste : Special : Values

If the whole thing is done in VBA you can avoid the copying of objects. Define a range variable and set it to the ranges you want to copy.  Then write that range to your paste location. I can help with some code if that isn't clear. 



    
-------------
Why is the data being manually copied when formulas exist to prevent this.
-------------
Well supposedly they're doing that, and it still ends up on the spreadsheet.

I don't thing the people in charge of the spreadsheet are gonna understand VBA coding

Would it be possible for you to automate the copy and pasting for them then? Pasting values should work (at least in 2007, what I'm on now) other than that there isn't going to be a way to copy and paste without grabbing the boxes. So you either have to loop through and delete them or automate the copy/paste to be writing values instead of copy/paste.

Hm how would I do the automated pasting?
-------------
Really depends how complex the copy and paste is.. If it is basic i.e. the ranges are the same layout A1:B4 to E5:F8 then something like the below will work

    Sub CopyPaste()
        Dim CopyRange As Range
        Dim PasteRange As Range
        
        Set CopyRange = Sheet1.Range("A1:B4")
        Set PasteRange = Sheet2.Range("E5:F8")
        
        PasteRange.Value = CopyRange.Value
    End Sub

Thanks, I'll let them know when I have time.

The below code will work for non continuous more complicated ranges

    Sub CopyPaste()
        Dim CopyRange As Range
        Dim PasteRange As Range
        Dim CopyArray As Variant
        Dim rCell As Range
        Dim i As Integer
        
        Set CopyRange = Sheet1.Range("A1:A4, E5:E8")
        Set PasteRange = Sheet2.Range("E5:F8")
        ReDim CopyArray(0 To 1)
        
        For Each rCell In CopyRange
            ReDim Preserve CopyArray(0 To i)
            CopyArray(i) = rCell.Value
            i = i + 1
        Next rCell

        i = 0
        For Each rCell In PasteRange
            rCell.Value = CopyArray(i)
            i = i + 1
        Next rCell
    End Sub
