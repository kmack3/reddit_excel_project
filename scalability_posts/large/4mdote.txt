Rush project - Make a small list of random values from a large list with no duplicates.

Need to create a total of 5,000 "lists" - each a row of 33 cells. List is made up of 15 cells from one range (A2:A29) of 28 and 18 cells from a separate range of 52 (B2:B53).

The cells in each list group need to be a random pull from the larger range, with no duplicates. 

Macro or formula welcome, thanks for your help.

I hate telling people to do helper cells but I think this solution is either VBA or...

On another sheet (rand!) fill in D1 through CE5000 with RAND().

On your sheet with the columns, in D1 you put:

    =if(column(A$1)<16,index($A$2:$A$29,rank(rand!D1,rand!$D1:$AE1)),index($B$2:$B$53,rank(rand!Q1,rand!$AF1:$CE1)))

copy over to cell AJ and down to row 5000

Nice, yeah I was already thinking VBA the best bet with multidimensional arrays to help keep track of what values have been used... it is sort of a big ask...

helper cells are fine!

I have it setup but have a few #ref! popping up: http://i.imgur.com/q8eF9aH.png

This is sample data, but it's behaving the same way as the real data

Sorry had to make a couple edits, I'm doing something a little funky because of your deal where you switch after 15 items. I counted wrong in my original

What's in there now should work, starting from D1...

    =if(column(A$1)<16,index($A$2:$A$29,rank(rand!D1,rand!$D1:$AE1)),index($B$2:$B$53,rank(rand!Q1,rand!$AF1:$CE1)))


edit: Please check that all selections from A and B show up somewhere in the 5000 sets (ie Whatever is in A29 and B53 show up at least once).

Perfect, solution verified! All selections are showing up, and surprisingly the amounts are pretty even across the board. Thank you so much! :)
