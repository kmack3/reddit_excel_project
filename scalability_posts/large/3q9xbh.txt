Best Coding Practices for a large office ( 100 + accountants)

As the title says, I have a bunch of staff writing their own code. This is great, but they do not write with Hungarian Notation and are deathly allergic to comments. When something breaks, a few of us have been ordained as the go-to and we normally have to just re-do it. I want to give everyone a solid standard on coding so that they get better at it and I can fix them faster.

Any tips on what you would have in the policy? 

Thanks in advance!


-------------
You have 100+ employees that somehow have different reporting needs?  
You are big enough now that you need databases and automation (a BI solution).  These people should be responsible for data input and validation, not for grouping, sorting, and aggregating.  
-------------
To start, a good practice would be to declare everything at the top of the module.  Create a variable for every Workbook, Worksheet, Range, string, or number.  You can even create Constants for numbers that are consistently used but never change throughout the code.  The helps to prevent errors from free typing things as well as making it easier to change one variable at the top rather than change every single instance within the code.  
  
Another would be to break the code into pieces rather than having one long continuous bunch of code.  The makes it easier to understand the code and narrow down where an error is coming from.  
  
If you have a lot of different people writing their own code then you could always have each contributor write their code into their own module.  This way, if you're not using comments then you'll still be able to see what code is coming from who.
-------------
Why not write a short training session to embed some basic standards like nomenclature, good practice guidelines as already mentioned (variable declaration, use of subroutines, breaking longer programs into separate modules, etc.)

My personal starting points are always to require variable declaration (every module I write has Option Explicit as the first line), use of Hungarian notation and declaring a variable for each worksheet. I'd also try to do some education about transitioning away from the horrors that are recorded macros, with all of their "Select this" and "Select that"!

Some pointers about use of loops is always a good place to start too. Once people understand the concept of loops, they will save so much time!

What kind of accountants are they that can code?
-------------
This is a great idea!

I agree with you all the way, however each individual client has their own needs. The BI team is focusing on creating other tools and what the staff are creating are low efficiency tools, like ETLs that our current system can't handle.

They could figure it out, but the BI team doesn't understand accounting so what they make sucks, hard.
-------------
By breaking up the code, are you referring to splitting the processes into many subs or using white space with commenting?

Thank you very much!

I guess record is more in line with what I find from a lot of them. But there are a good number that do it and follow some coding standards.
-------------
That's just bad BI management.  They didn't collect enough requirements to make the correct solution.

Both, it all depends on what works better for you.  You can create a bunch of different subs and then have a main sub that calls all the smaller ones.  This will allow you to pinpoint the exact sub and in tern the exact piece of code when running into an error.  
  
You can also have one large sub but neatly organize the different sections using new lines and tabs.  Commenting also makes this type of break-up easier to understand but I know you said that no one likes comments.

Yep. You nailed it.

I actually do the main sub that calls the rest. It's also where I connect my status bar so that I know which step I am at and how long it's taking. This is great! I will add it to my list!
