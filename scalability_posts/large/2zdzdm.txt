Need help getting information from a large sales history report.

I have several items that are arranged like this:



Order Number| Part Number | Price | Quantity
---|---|----|----

What I want to do is be able to sum up the total number of each part number regardless of what order number it's under and I'm not sure how to do that.  For example.  Order number 1000 may have 5 of part number APPLE, and order number 2006 might have 2 of part number APPLE.  How can I go through the spread sheet and total how many APPLEs I have?


-------------
pivot table.

    =SUMIF(B:B,"APPLE",D:D)

Assuming that the part numbers are in column B and quantities in column D

Without seeing it, this seems like the best solution

This was what I was looking for.  Thanks!

That would work if I only had a small number of part numbers, but there are hundreds.  Is there a way to get all distinct part numbers by themselves and then sum data on the same row with it?

Yes. You can make a list of unique part numbers. Let's say your list is in F1:F100, you can put in G1:

    =SUMIF(B:B,F1,D:D)

and drag the formula down until G100 or wherever you list ends. Does that help?
