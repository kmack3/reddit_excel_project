changing a large array to multiple single rows

I have a large array that I want to modify. 

Rows with identical A column values would be merged to a single row, without repeating column A value. Does this make sense? I have images of an example, much smaller array in the before and ideal after states.

Currently, I am filtering the array to just identical A values, copy pasting to a different sheet with a prenamed array, then use this formula,

=INDEX(b,1+INT((ROW(A1)-1)/COLUMNS(b)),MOD(ROW(A1)-1+COLUMNS(b),COLUMNS(b))+1)

have it preset to be dragged down the necessary number of rows, copy that single column array, paste values transposed as a row in a different, new array. 

As you can imagine this is painful as I currently have thousands of rows and in the final array will be left with about 100.

ok, do this, copy your entire column A to new sheet, delete duplicates from pre-defined function in data ribbon at the top, then use transpose function

try the Tableau Reshaping Tool. It's free and I THINK this is what it does

Wow, this is crazy. I'm curious why do you need this?

I would look for a solution in VBA. Just set up a macro that use the excel built in tool to filter unique column A (just like what you're doing now). Then the macro loops, for each unique element, all elements in the original table getting the info you need.
If this is too slow then you will need to get all the data to an array, sort and index it for make it faster.
Let me know if it helps.

I'm not sure I'm understanding you correctly. 

1. I copy column A to a new sheet.
2. I then remove duplicates from the original array? or from this copied column?
3. If I remove duplicates from the original array, then transpose the array. I get this: [screens](http://imgur.com/a/RJQom)

I am doing something wrong?

Here is a simpler example

Make:

A - red - 5

A - blue - 7

B - purple - 3

B - pink - 4

Into: 

A - red - 5 - blue - 7

B - purple - 3 - pink - 4

Thank you, I'll look into this.

Yes, I was considering making a macro, but have never used VBA before.

The import tool that this file is going to be fed into requires a given account's properties to be in a single row. If they are in multiple rows or multiple uploads on the same column headers the values will just be overwritten.

Ok ok...
See if this code works for you (you may need to adjust the ranges):



      Option Explicit
      
      Public vData As Variant
      Public vUniqueIds As Variant
      
      Sub Main()
         Dim N As Long, K As Long, L As Long
         Dim sTemp As String
         vData = Sheet1.Range("a1").CurrentRegion
         Call GetUniqueEmails
         For N = 2 To UBound(vUniqueIds)
            Sheet2.Range("A1")(N, 1) = vUniqueIds(N, 1)
            L = 1
            For K = 2 To UBound(vData)
               If vData(K, 1) = vUniqueIds(N, 1) Then
                  Sheet2.Range("A1")(N, L + 1) = vData(K, 2)
                  Sheet2.Range("A1")(N, L + 2) = vData(K, 3)
                  Sheet2.Range("A1")(N, L + 3) = vData(K, 4)
                  Sheet2.Range("A1")(N, L + 4) = vData(K, 5)
                  Sheet2.Range("A1")(N, L + 5) = vData(K, 6)
                  Sheet2.Range("A1")(N, L + 6) = vData(K, 7)
                  L = L + 6
               End If
            Next K
         Next N
      End Sub
      
      Function GetUniqueEmails() As Variant
         Dim WS As Worksheet
         Set WS = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add
         WS.Range("a1").Resize(UBound(vData), 1) = vData
         WS.Range("a1").CurrentRegion.RemoveDuplicates Columns:=1, Header:=xlYes
         vUniqueIds = WS.Range("a1").CurrentRegion
         Application.DisplayAlerts = False
         WS.Delete
         Application.DisplayAlerts = True
         Set WS = Nothing
      End Function

Thank you! I changed the range and ran it and it worked almost perfectly. It broke half way through, probably just due to some formatting issue. But I just ran it again on just the remainder and patched the halves together.


Thank you so much! Very helpful.
