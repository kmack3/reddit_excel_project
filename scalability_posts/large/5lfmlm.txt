Writing an Initiative tracker for dnd, problems with duplicate values in a "Vlookup" and Large" function combo

i am using the function =IFERROR(VLOOKUP(LARGE(E$2:E$21,ROW(1:1)),E$2:F$21,2,FALSE),"") to find the largest of a numerical value from the table E2:E21 and taking the name from the corresponding F column, to essentially create and initiative tracker for DnD.

however, i have a problem when the numerical values have duplicates, meaning two entries have, for example, "4". i will receive Joe for example, whereas Stacy might also have "4" as her initiative.

what can i do to allow both names to show up, either arranging them based on another number, or just randomly placing them?

Assuming you are playing fifth edition, ties to the initiative roll are determined by the dexterity modifier.

Therefore, I will add a couple of columns after E. First column (F) holds the initiative roll, and second (G) holds the dexterity mod. I will change column E as follows:

    =F2 + G2/10 + row()/1000

Do the necessary modifications to your VLOOKUP formula, and you don't need to worry about duplicates. Any ties to both initiative roll and dexterity modifier will be broken by the row number - later entries go first.

If you want to use a vlookup for two duplicate values, you will need to use an index match formula instead.


How big is your data? Is there any reason you couldn't just sort by that column and then use if statements to see if the 2nd, 3rd, etc row is the same number?

1st do a check on same values and get a list of them, then each set of duplicates do a 2nd roll and put the higher number as a decimal smaller then the rest of the rolls (if you use 0.0# use 0.00# or 0.000#) lastly fill in the statements false as the normal value sort using the new column

It is in fact 5e, im not very experienced with excel, so may you explain to me what modifications i need to make to my VLOOKUP formula?

currently E contains the initiative rolls and F contains character names, assuming I make column G the Initiative modifier, what would i need to do to my VLOOKUP formula?

Edit: I took it one step at a time, and it seems to work. Thank you and everyone else who replied!
