How to sum multiple lines in a large dataset, then delete the duplicates.

See the sample format of my report below. The first column is a "case number". The values in the second column represent how much time has been spent on each case. All I need is the total time for each case number, but unfortunately the product I'm using only exports each individual time entry for each case, which means sometimes I have only one time entry, sometimes there can be 6 or 7. What I'm doing now is having to manually add the time for each case, then delete the duplicate case numbers so that I can ultimately create a graph and also calculate the average TOTAL time per case, not per time entry. Surely there's a way to automate this. 

If you look at the example data below, the objective is to end up with 3 line items, one for 1001, one for 1002 and one for 1003. The total time on 1001 is 1.0, total time for 1002 is .75, total time for 1003 is .5. 

The typical report that i'm dealing with has this similar type format that contains over 500 line items, so obviously this takes a while to do manually. Thanks in advance!! 

1001      .5
1001      .25
1001      .25
1002      .75
1003      .25
1003      .25 

Resulting spreadsheet should be: 
1001     1.0
1002       .75
1003       .5

(notice the duplicate case numbers are then removed)

**Please note that the forum changed the format of my post. 1001, 1002, and 1003 should be in columns (first column). The decimal numbers should be in the second column. The post reformatted this and put all data in one line, not my intent. Thanks!

Suppose column A has the numbers 1001, 1002, 1003 etc and column B has the decimals (.5, .25, .25 etc). 

When you could do is have at, say G1 place 1001. Then at G2 have the formula: 

    =INDEX($A$1:$A$1000,MATCH(TRUE,INDEX($A$1:$A$1000>G1,),0))

And drag down. 

Then at H1 and also dragging down have: 

    =SUMIF($A$1:$A$100,G1,$B$1:$B$100)

There are many solutions to this. I will give you two of them:

1) Take the distinct values of the first column, and then use the following formula:

    =SUMIF($A$2:$A$7,D2,$B$2:$B$7)

2) Use Pivot Table to sum it up
-------------
This

| A | B |
|---|---|
|1001| .5|
| 1001| .25|
| 1001| .25 |
|1002 | .75|
| 1003| .25|
| 1003 |.25|

To This

| A | B |
|---|---|
|1001| 1.0|
| 1002| .75|
| 1003| .5|

Can be done with a pivot table pretty easily and have a nice tidy reduction of data without impacting your source.

Select your range, Insert>Pivot Table

Case number in the rows, Value in the Values 

If it shows as a count, just change the Values to Sum.

This way it can be updated on the fly as more data is added.

As others have said, a pivot table is the easiest way to do this. [Here is a gif showing you the steps.](http://i.imgur.com/CpqHt1m.gifv) 

One thing to watch out for is that it doesn't default to Count of Time in the Values box. If it does, click on the arrow, go to Value Field Settings and choose Sum.

Fuzzius, thanks so much! Can't believe how easy that was. I asked a few folks in the office before posting and wasn't quite sure what I would even search for as I wasn't clear this was a pivot table resolution. Makes total sense and works. Thanks all for the replies, but this was the easiest for me. You guys rock!!

Really happy to read this. Sometimes the solution is less complicated than we imagine it to be and it just takes another perspective to straighten it out.
