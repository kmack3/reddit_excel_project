Multiple Pivot Tables from same data source resulting in large file. Is there any way to consolidate the intermediate data?

I have a workbook that has 10+ pivot tables pulling from one access database. The file has become to large to email. The users I send this out to need to be able to manipulate the pivot tables and do not have access to the database. 

I need to combine intermediate data for all of these pivot tables, preferably without having to start over. Is there a way to do this?


-------------
Try saving it as a .xlsb binary notebook, and see if that works.

... do you need he data connection to remain capable of refreshing after sending it?
-------------
... do you need to email it? Can you use dropbox, or a shared GDrive directory to distribute the file?
-------------
Yes, I do. I have not tried saving it as a binary file. What's the difference?

My boss strongly prefers direct emails. He doesn't like google drive or Dropbox for some reason. 

But I'd just like to speed up the workbook in general
