Automate a weekly report summarizing variable range of large data

Being used across multiple versions of Excel. Open to macros or formulas, tried creating a template to import the data into but need something simpler because the users don't use excel much at all.

Anywhere from 2,500 rows a week to 250,000 depending on how busy we are and the specs for the orders. 

Multiple rows of the same job, to eliminate dups I was using CSE formula:
 
    =INDEX($A:$A, MATCH(0, COUNTIF($B$4:B5,$A:$A), 0)))

It was slow and the range was overkill in some cases but it needs to be large enough to capture all the data. 

For the cost columns I was using:

    =SUMIF($A:$H,$B6,INDEX($A:$H,1,MATCH(C$5,$1:$1,0)))
Worked fine if I copied it down far enough, but again it was slow, is there a way that Excel can change the range to match the "table"? Without manual naming it or any other steps that a beginner would mess up?

> is there a way that Excel can change the range to match the "table"?

You can use a named range with OFFSET to create a dynamic range. You can also format your range as a Table, and the ranges will size as needed, which is what I'd recommend as a start.

But how much do you know about Pivot Tables and data connection features? The data analysis on those are incredible, the formatting will need tweaking though. But they are tied to data which can be tied to other sheets/databases/files. So you could have users just put raw data in one file, then your spreadsheet, upon opening, will pull in all that data, which can handle 2 billion rows, and put it all in a Pivot Table.
-------------
I've never used pivot tables before, do you have an example of the settings to get the data laid out correctly?

You can always format the data any way you like in a separate sheet and just use GETPIVOTDATA formula to pull results from the PivotTable. I use it daily for my reports.

Once you get data together (which admittedly is hard - Excel is great at cross-referencing data, but if you have multiple tables with the same data fields, you have to use the Alt+D+P old wizard, or create a bunch of connections and combine the tables manually), creating [the table is easy by dragging fields between those boxes on the lower right](http://i.imgur.com/RogUtRf.png). And you [can easily filter and resort data](http://i.imgur.com/4djXP8o.png) once it's in there.
-------------
That's a very good point. I feel like I don't trust that function, but as long as you don't rearrange data from the Pivot Table it works well, right?
-------------
Can the pivot table use the source data to create the finished report?

I can't make sense of them. 

Edit: Sum got me closer - just can't figure out the percent of Act vs Est

You can rearrange, but all the parts of the initial formula must be openly present.

For instance, if you have a PivotTable and a GETPIVOTDATA formula with 3 categories of Year, Month and Day, you can rearrange their positions or add more categories like Hour or Second, but if you remove (or move to the 'Filter' part of the PivotTable) one of the categories mentioned in GETPIVOTDATA, it will stop working.

What I usually do for reports is getting the data, creating a PivotTable with maximum details and just pulling results from it with a formula. This way when I need to update information, I just replace the source data, refresh the PivotTable, and voila - my report is updated.
-------------
To get it to look just like the finished report, you would need a Pivot Table per week. Using the Pivot Table as it was designed, you'd have one source table, with Week as a column, and then drag Week so it's above the Job on the Rows box, and it will categorize based on that.

But I think your setup so far is good, except you probably want sums instead of counts for those top two categories in the Values box. So right click on your data and go to Value field settings.

And if you're doing a dashboard, insert a Pivot Chart, too - it's the visual representation of the Pivot Table and is just as configurable.
-------------
Right, my hope is to figure out the steps, create a macro and be done with it. 

Can column D be made to look like column F? C/B as a percentage?

Think that's the last hurdle. 

-------------
You can create formulas in the pivot table. I believe they are called calculated fields in the pivot table. Pretty easy, look it up. Can't remember off the top of my head and on my phone in bed.
-------------
Oh yeah, Google calculated fields,and format as a percentage.
