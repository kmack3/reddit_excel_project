Having trouble graphing big data in Excel (3500+ rows, 2 columns)

I'm trying to show a relationship between two categories but the only problem is there's too much data!

Problem: Is there a relationship between X and Y? X and Y are ratings and I'm trying to see if there is a correlation from rating X 1-10 and a resulting 1-10 rating for Y.

To repeat my scenario please do =randbetween(1,10) for two columns and 3500+ rows

X                                              Y
=randbetween(1,10)          =randbetween(1,10)
3500 rows                           3500 rows

Any idea how to show this in excel?


-------------
>X Y =randbetween(1,10) =randbetween(1,10) 3500 rows 3500 rows

I don't understand this statement

*Edit: It let me graph the random numbers but why would you want to graph random number?*

Data analysis add on. Descriptive statistics. Highlight area select correlation.
-------------
x                                           y
=randbetween(1,10)              =randbetween(1,10)

sorry the formatting is a bit off. I was trying to show the data I'm currently working with. X and Y are separate columns and it's generating random numbers between 1-10. Please drag that down to 3500 rows and it's basically the data I'm working with. I'm not sure how to graph this.

I'll take a pic when I get home for more clarity.

Here are a few scenarios since I don't know exactly what you're asking. 

1) If you want the values in column A to be the x values and the values in column B to be the y values, you would end up graphing a solid(whole number points) square that goes from 1-10 on the vertical and horizontal axis. 

2) Any other possibility creates a line that continues for 3500 units in the horizontal direction and randomly and jaggedly  oscillates between 1 and 10 on the vertical axis.

Hi

Thank you, 1 is my issue. The data that I collected is a rating scale from 1-10 and I wanted to see the relationship between the two categories. Is there a better way to represent the data?
