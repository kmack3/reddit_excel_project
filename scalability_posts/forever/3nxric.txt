Please help with excel graph!! Been stuck on this forever.

So, I need my graph to look like figure 2 of the rubric. This has been an incredibly tedious project. I can not figure out how to sort the values on the graph from lowest to highest without changing the data on the spreadsheet. Thank you so much!

-------------
Your X-values for the graph are wrong. Should be E4:E14. 
-------------
You only need one series. Delete the years exp series and the predicted salary series and just use the Salary series. Change the x values to the years Exp (E4:E14) and the Y values to the Salary (F4:F14). Then apply the line of fit.

Thank you so much you saved me!
