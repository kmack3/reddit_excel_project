forever

Why does Array Formula calculations take forever if computer is untouched, but finish much quicker if I scroll to bottom of table where data will fill up?

I have a table that has a very complex array formula on one column, and 8 other columns that use Index and Match with the result from that array formula. After pasting in the input data, on which the array formula works on, and leaving Excel alone, the calculations can take more than an hour to finish.  

However, if I mess around with the scroll bar (it doesn't calculate the full scroll range in the beginning), and scroll to the bottom of the table when Excel allows me to, the calculations finish 10 times faster.  

What's going on? Is this a bug with Excel?

This might not solve your problems, but have you tried using PowerPivot? It is an add-in developed specifically for large datasets. It can handle billion of data much faster than vanilla Excel.
-------------
I've seen before too, and its one of the more nefarious excel bugs. It doesn't finish quicker, it just stops calculating everything if you click or scroll.

I don't think I can get such proprietary software installed on corporate computers. It's a shame I don't know VBA.

No it does finish much quicker. It pauses when scrolling but it completes faster. I ran the calculations without touching anything in Excel, it took 1 hour. When I played with the scroll bar, all the data was correctly computed in 6 minutes.

If you have Excel 2016, it's already installed! PowerPivot has been developed by Microsoft, but it's not activated by default because people won't generally need it. Try looking [here](http://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office/excel/activate-excels-power-pivot-add/) to activate it, and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ms149Qi2PVA) for a quick overview to see if it can actually help you

Is it available for Mac?
-------------
Sadly, Office 2013 is used instead of 2016.

Nope, you can request it [here](https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac/suggestions/8995483-add-support-for-power-components-power-pivot-que)

Can't you ask to upgrade? It's such a small investment for such a huge benefit that it'd embarrassing for your company not to do it. Searches on the sub for topics on benefits of upgrading.
