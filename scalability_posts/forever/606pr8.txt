Deleting large datasets in Excel 2016 takes forever and frequently crashes the program

I've noticed that when I try to delete a large number rows and columns with formulas and data in them, it takes absolutely forever to just delete them and frequently hangs/crashes the program. Excel 2016 seems to recalculate every single cell before deleting them. I'm not sure why its doing this. I've even set automatic calculation of formulas to manual before starting to delete. Does anyone have a solution to this problem?

Also, by delete I mean that I just press the "Delete" button on my keyboard.

One thing you may want to try is to copy/paste special as values; then hit the delete button.

Are you deleting in a table?

Did that but still crashes the program after I press delete. Excel 2016 can't seem to handle more than 10000 rows spanning several columns with formulas in them it seems...:(

Nah, not deleting a table, Basically I have several columns that span about thousands rows with some IF loops and ROW formulas in them that calculate stuff.

Can you upload the Workbook somewhere or it does behave the same if I randomly fill a 10.000 rows x 30 columns sheet?  

edit: that's, however, strange. For testing purposes I did a script that fills a 100.000 rows x 31 columns with garbage and hadn't any problems.

Within a table...
