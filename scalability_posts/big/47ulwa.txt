Not a power user, but work with big excel files, what's the best Mac solution?

I don't really consider myself a power user and don't do anything crazy, but I do often have multiple worksheets open that are fairly large. 500k rows, 20 columns is normal.

I have Office 365 right now and the beach ball just comes up way too often.

I have the newest rMBP (base model)




-------------
Have you tried saving the files in excel binary format? 

Is the file larger than the amount of RAM you have? If it's pure CSV try opening it with VIM. 

Otherwise another way is to use CLI or scripting language (Python) to read the file

The 64bit Windows version in parallels ?

I've never had good experiences with Excel files that size on a Mac. No idea why though.

Are you running the 32 bit or 64 bit version of Office 365? The 32 bit version can only use 2gb of ram, which isn't really enough for a file that large.

Depending on what you're doing, it might not take long to learn how to do what you need by importing your csv/xlsx into R. In my experience most excel formulas have fairly straightforward equivalents in R. If you go that route I'd recommend using Rstudio.
