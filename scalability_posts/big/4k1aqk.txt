I work in Tech Support and feel like it's a dead-end job. I was looking to advance my IT skills and didn't realize how big Excel is. Just curious, is this something you'd recommend?

I always knew Excel was big in Finance, and although I love finance and think financial modeling is interesting, I don't think I could get into it as I don't have the proper schooling.  
   
In terms of excel though, for people who learn it on their own, what are some of the careers you think one could get assuming they become an expert in it? Is it something you'd recommend one learn? I'm just in tech support right now and looking to move up in my career.  
   
What do you think?

Take a look here for career info:

Most of the 'Excel Expert' jobs are Business Analyst type roles, where you have a bunch of Raw data and have to A. make it look pretty, and B. do analysis on the data to find 'stuff'.
