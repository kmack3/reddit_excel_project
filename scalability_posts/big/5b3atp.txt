Would there be any appetite for a live Excel coaching business based on the big investment bank's intake programmes and made applicable to all?

I’m wondering if there would be any appetite for something I’m thinking of starting.  I’m a technology coach and ran the European Investment Banking Technology Coaching team at Morgan Stanley for many years.  I worked directly with management and the guys on the ground to design and run their technology coaching programmes including the intake programmes for interns, full time analysts and MBAs as well as senior hires.  Our biggest topic was Excel and we ensured that these guys were business ready with it and risk free before they arrived at their desks and supported them with it on an ongoing basis.


I left the firm a while ago but have been invited back to assist with other intakes and I’m now thinking of providing similar coaching online.  I’ve made it a bit more generic so it’s not just banking specific and I think it’d be really useful for anyone who’s looking to get into the business world or just move within it.


This is unique and directly relevant Excel coaching that I know big employers want their staff to have. It covers relevant Excel functionality but with a focus on the things you absolutely need to know to create professional, usable, scaleable and accurate models for use within a corporate team and that can be presented to clients.  I would incorporate all the shortcuts, hints, tips and best practices that are relevant in the business world.  In short, all the stuff that’s going to give you a real advantage and will save you so much misery with re-creating things if you don’t know it.  This is the stuff that’s going to make your VP think you’re a safe pair of hands and not the person who they have to send back with endless mark ups and who needs constant monitoring.
If you think this would be good knowledge to have, I’d love to hear your thoughts.  I do need to eat so I’d charge for this but it would be really affordable.  I would deliver these modules live, online using Skype/Google Hangouts/Live Meeting etc so you can ask questions and get an immediate answer.  I’m based in the UK so I’m in a great time zone to accommodate anyone wherever they are in the world and we have a currency that makes these modules really affordable at present!
I’ve run some experimental modules in person over here in the UK and they were well received.  I’ve been considering taking it online to a wider audience so I just thought I’d check to see what the appetite is further afield.
I’d welcome genuine comments.

**Edit**
I don't think I made it clear above that this isn't specifically Excel training which, I appreciate, is available elsewhere for free.


**To answer other questions...**


The modules I'd run wouldn’t be specifically for banking students so no, I don’t expect banking knowledge.  I’ve stripped out the banking-specific models and examples so that anyone from any industry background can understand them.  The modules do start at the beginning with Excel because they’re designed for people who might have studied a subject that simply doesn’t use much Excel (history, theology, law, medicine etc) so I go back to the beginning with them and fill in the blanks and start to iron out bad habbits.
With that in mind, I’m bringing people up to a good level of Excel usage but within the context of a corporate job.  This means they’ll fill in gaps in their knowledge but will learn, among others, things like:


How to avoid ruining the usability of a model by inappropriate formatting (and I’m not talking colour schemes).  


Learning what functions are actually used in the real world, which ones aren’t, which ones are flawed and can give you wrong results and which ones are just used as discussion points.  


How to avoid crashing models, how to spot when workbooks are corrupt and what to do about them when it happens.  


How to make models that the rest of your team can use (which allows you to live in peace!).  


How to use Excel quickly, efficiently and accurately (this is continually the biggest request of management).  


How to create output that’s appropriate and compatible with your clients.  


Why circular references can be useful and how to manage them.  


What is the reality with the pros and cons of array formulas and how are they viewed in the real world.  


All the best practices that large firms want and need you to know so that your models are professional, useable, accurate and can grow with the demands made on it.  And a load more...

Hi,  

It is interesting but could you please provide more details on the following points :  

 - Do you expect banking knowledge from your students? If yes, level? If no do you provide the minimum required?  
 - What type of excel users are you targeting? Beginners, advanced, expert? Is it more about handling data, arrange it and present it or does it revolve more around buildings models?  
 - Then sorry for the basic business questions but How much/How long? I can understand if you can not give precise answers to these questions but are we talking about 10€/h or 100€/h? Is it a 2H thing or multiple sessions of few hours?  
  
  
Sorry for all the questions but concerning Excel you can learn a lot by yourself and for free, or you can find online courses (not free) but with official degrees.  

So in the end I find your proposal interesting but if I need to pay for it, I need to know what I am paying for.  

Anyway thank you and let me know

Have you tried searching online to see if this service is already offered?

Love the idea, but I'm quite hesitant to spend money (I'm assuming it would be at least a couple hundred $$$) on an online type course.

I'm interested

Hi

Thanks for taking time to read my thread. I've edited the title to explain a few more things.
With regard to cost, I'd charge about £30(GBP) per session.  I aim to run sessions of 1 hour and the idea is that attendees can pick which ones they attend although I'd want to get a rough level of ability beforehand as it's annoying for everyone to have an expert on a beginner course or to have a beginner on an expert level.
You're right that you can learn all of Excel for free.  I believe there are very few people who can can offer knowledge direct from the floors of an investment bank and express what they want and, if someone's interested in heading in that direction, it'd be more valuable than simply knowing raw facts.

Hi
Thanks for replying.  I understand exactly where you're coming from with regards paying for it.  I've added some detail around my initial proposal which answers more questions.
The way I'm planning it online is that I'd present modules of around an hour in length and would charge about £30pp/module.  I'd have a website that would outline some content and would be open to discussing with individuals what's in the modules and it'd be up to each individual which ones they attend.
