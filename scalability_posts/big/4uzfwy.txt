Really small number, showing up as whole, big integers. Ex. 7.6e-5 shows up as 7 on the axis. How do I get the axis to display the numbers correctly?

I am nit understanding what excel is doing. Why would it convert to a numerical value that isn't even what the columns indicate?

You might want to check the format for the column.  If the cells are formatted to include 0 decimals, that might be why your numbers "cuts off" and appears bigger than it is.

Didn't solve the problem. But I was able to fix it. Thanks, though!
