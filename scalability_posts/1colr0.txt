Big list of Excel PC and Mac shortcuts side-by-side

I've put together a big list of Excel shortcuts for both the Mac and Win, listed side-by-side:

Useful for anyone who needs to use Excel on both platforms.

Missing Ctrl + PGUP/PGDN to move to the next/previous sheet in the navigation section?
-------------
I'm not really sure that the arrow keys count as shortcuts but still, nice work. 
-------------
i think i'm being really dumb here, but what key on the mac keyboard does the "^" symbol represent? for example, in the "edit cell" shortcut that is covered by F2 in windows - this one has stumped me for a long time and it isn't working with function, carol, alt or command for me! i'm assuming you don't mean shift+6, right?
-------------
These are actually listed in the "workbook" section, along with next and prev workbook. Debatable for sure.
-------------
Yeah. It's a little granular. Also, in some cases, shortcuts are listed more than once (e.g. selecting a column in a table). This shortcut is the same as selecting a column in the worksheet (ctrl-space) but the behavior is a little different in a table, so I decided to list twice. In general, I am trying to organize around related tasks, instead of keys (which I've always found strange...a legacy from the 80's maybe).

Do you mean the âŒƒ symbol? If so, that's the control key, so Control-U should go to cell edit mode on a Mac (works here). The shortcut is here: http://exceljet.net/keyboard-shortcuts/edit-the-active-cell
