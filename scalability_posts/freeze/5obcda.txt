Custom Pane Freeze?

Good morning everyone :)

I have a spreadsheet that contains data from A - L. I was wondering if I would be able to freeze the colomns A - F, and have G - L (and beyond) scrollable.

I appreciate all insight!

[Yes you can!](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Freeze-panes-to-lock-rows-and-columns-dab2ffc9-020d-4026-8121-67dd25f2508f) Just select the columns you want to freeze, and select the Freeze Pane option.

Ughhh. I was highlighting all the panes as opposed to just one. I appreciate your help - have a wonderful day!
