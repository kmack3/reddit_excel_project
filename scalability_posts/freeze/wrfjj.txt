freeze

Is it possible to freeze two different sets of cells?

I am trying to freeze a section at the top going left to right and then have the date in the middle scroll up and down, then I also want to have the totals at the bottom frozen. I am using an older version of excel (2002). I am also a noob at excel. Thank you in advance for your help.


-------------
Freezing only works at the top and left, not the bottom.
