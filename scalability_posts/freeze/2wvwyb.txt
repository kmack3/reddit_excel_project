Advanced Freeze pane options?

I've got a number of pivot tables on one sheet and i would like the column titles to be frozen at the top as i scroll

BUT

the column titles change as i scroll. 

Is there a way i can get the free pane to change when i scroll down to a certain point, kind of like the way having [tables does](http://imgur.com/GtwO9L0)

Freeze panes is generally inflexible, and multiple pivot tables stacked on top of eachother gives problems if they change size and start overwriting one another. 

You just mean that you want the header of whatever table you are currently in, to be frozen at the top, right?


I don't know how to do that in any non-macro way, but dependingon your sheet you can piece together something like this: 

    Private Sub worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal target As Range)
    On Error GoTo 99
    debug.print target.PivotTable.Value
    rows(1).clear
    n = target.PivotTable.TableRange1.Columns.Count
    For j = 1 To n
    Cells(1, j).Value = target.PivotTable.TableRange1.Cells(1, j).Value
    Next j
    99
    End Sub

Where, as you key down through your pivot tables, it checks if your current selection is a pivot table. If it is, it clears row A1, then replaces the value of the cells in row 1 (from A to whatever), with the values in the first row of your pivot table. 

You'll probably have to play around with how your pivot tables look, to get it to display what you want, and it might get a bit clunky, but it's the only thing I could think of that would do sort of what you're looking for. 

edit: small change to code, removing if, relying on error handling if not a pt

Thanks for your time writing the code for this i'll plonk it in and play around.

Thanks again!
