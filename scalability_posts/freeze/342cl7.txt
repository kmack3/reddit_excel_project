Freeze Tabs - like Freeze Panes?

Is there a way to freeze tabs - that would function similar to freeze panes?

That is, if I set a tab named "Dash" to be the 1st (leftmost) tab, is there a setting/feature to make it always visible?

You can protect the structure of a workbook so no one else can add, delete, hide, or unhide sheets, amongst any other structural updates.

I worked around a similar situation by creating two macros, one that always brought me back to the first sheet, and one that brought me back to the last active sheet that is not the first sheet. I then bound them to ctrl,shift,H for home and ctrl,shift,b for back. Would that help you?
-------------
Quick answer: no.

The main alternative would be using a macro to switch to the *pinned* worksheet. Possible to embellish such a macro to check whether it's been called while you're in the pinned worksheet or not. If not, meaning you want to switch to the pinned worksheet, the macro would store the worksheet from which you're switching in a Static variable, then switch to the pinned worksheet. If so, meaning you call the macro while you're in the pinned worksheet, it'd switch back to the stored nonpinned worksheet.

Simple example.

    Private prvt_pinnedws As Worksheet
    
    Sub setpinnedws()
      Set prvt_pinnedws = ActiveSheet
    End Sub
    
    Sub togglepinnedws()
      Static ws As Worksheet
      If ActiveSheet Is prvt_pinnedws Then
        If Not ws Is Nothing Then ws.Activate
      Else
        Set ws = ActiveSheet
        If Not prvt_pinnedws Is Nothing Then prvt_pinnedws.Activate
      End If
    End Sub

Run the first macro, setpinnedws while the pinned worksheet is active. Assign a keyboard shortcut like [Ctrl]+N to the second macro, togglepinnedws. Move to another worksheet, press [Ctrl]+N. You should be back in the pinned worksheet. Press [Ctrl]+N again. You should be back in the other worksheet.

If you're just trying to make it easier to switch to a particular worksheet, you can right click in the area to the left of the first sheet.

That will bring up a list of all the sheets in the current workbook, and you can pick which one to activate.

There's also the TabHound add-in from Jon Acampora: http://www.excelcampus.com/tab-hound/

I am working with a sheet (handed down to me, of course), that has ~40 sheets of data. WHile I am in the process of aggregating and summarizing, it would be helpful to be able to click on the 1st tab, without having to scroll past a bunch of tabs to get there. I know that I can drag it and move it along wth me, but was hoping someone knew of a fix.
-------------
I don't have the solution you're looking for, but here's another idea that might work:

    Include a new sheet called something like "Contents" or "Navigation".
    Include a hyperlink to that new sheet in the freeze pane of each of the other sheets, using a formula like:
    =HYPERLINK("#"&CELL("address",'Contents'!$A$1),"Click for contents")
    Include a bunch of hyperlinks on that new sheet to all the places you want to easily access.
-------------
To add on what the other guy said. There is an easy macro somewhere online that creates an index sheet and links to that sheet on A1 of every other sheet. The index sheet than links to every other sheet. Am in mobile, but just Google excel automatic index vba or something and you will easily find it. If needed you can tinker with it to behave differently. IIIRC the page's name was something including "university". 
-------------
Oh, I misinterpreted what you meant. No as far as I know there is no way to lock the tabs.

An alternative way of getting to a tab you want instead of arrowing over to the left/right, you can right click on the left/right arrows (the ones that scroll through the tabs, not the scrollbar for the tab you are in) then it pops up with a list of all the tabs and you can easily use the mouse wheel to get to the top of that list and double click the tab you want.
-------------
You can also control+click the arrows to jump to the first/last.

Oh cool! I never knew that!
