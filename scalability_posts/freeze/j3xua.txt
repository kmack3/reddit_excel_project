How do I use the freeze frame function?

I'm trying to edit my excel document so that when the user scrolls, the left and top sections remain visible.

I've applied the freeze frame function to the left, however now it has been duplicated, is this normal?

I'm trying to add the freeze frame to the top section...but it wont let me..

See this [picture](http://i.imgur.com/51cNn.png). I would Like the left section to remain still (as it currently is), as well as the top (Term 1 - 4) and the numbers (1-10).

The second lot of numbers don't necessarily have to remain still.

Any ideas?

Doesn't look like you've freezed the frame... looks more like you dragged from the side.   Drag that off to the left, select the cell you want to lock so that the UPPER LEFT of the selection borders the edges....looking at this, I'll hazard to guess you want it in Column C, Row... "Statement of Interest" and then "Freeze Panes" is in the View Ribbon (assuming 2007+)
