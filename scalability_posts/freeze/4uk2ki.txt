Freeze Pane does not freeze selection

Hello, I am try to simply freeze one row, but excel 2007 only freezes the top row. 

Eg: I have my table starting at row 2, with a blank row on row 1. I select my row of 3 and click freeze panes (top row). The freeze frame is applied to row 1. 

Thanks for any help.


-------------
"Freeze Top Row" will only freeze row 1. Choose just "Freeze Panes" to freeze at your selection. If your cursor is in the first column of row 3, for example, then everything above that will be frozen (both rows 1 and 2).

Edit: Wow, thanks for the gold!

God, I am such an idiot, thanks!
