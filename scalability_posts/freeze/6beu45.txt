Freeze rows/columns in Excel 14?

I can't figure out how to freeze a row or column in Excel 14. I looked online and it says to hit the "View" tab in excel, but I don't have that tab, I only have Home, Layout, Tables, Charts, SmartArt, Formulas, Data, and Review... none of which have a freeze option... Help?
