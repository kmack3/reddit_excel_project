Freeze calculating certain cells only, or calculate only between certain hours.

Hi gang,

I have a live feed of market prices condensed into a pivot table with some calculation. One group of products in that feed however, has a an accounting timetable different from the rest, where the official accounting or settlement is 2 hours before the rest of the products i look at. To track the daily performance I would like only the certain cells to no longer calculate if the local time is between 15:15 and 17:01 and stay with whatever the last calculation was, whilst letting other cells calculate as normal. Is that possible?


-------------
If you were to capture the ticks/prices into a table along with a timestamp, you could select data out of that filtering on age and price type.
-------------
my position is already a 4000plus entry "database", any kind of storing of live feeds would increase that exponentially. I really just want to stop refreshing cells based on what group of products they belong to if possible.

There's nothing built in.

You'd have to add formulas which pick up data appropriately based on the time - referencing cells which contain real-time data until a certain time and thereafter referencing a (previously snapshotted or dated row) at other times.

okidok, thanks
