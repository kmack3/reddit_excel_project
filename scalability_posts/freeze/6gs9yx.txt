Freeze Top 4 Rows and the Firsts column

I've been looking around this sub (albeit not to extensively) and can't find an answer to this.   I know how to freeze the top four rows, and I know how to freeze the first column but they seem to be independent of each other.  I can do one or the other, not both.  Is there a way to Freeze the top 4 rows AND the first column?


-------------
Put your cursor in cell B5. Make sure no rows or columns are frozen and then go View -> Freeze Panes -> Freeze Panes.

It'll now lock the first 4 rows and first column.
