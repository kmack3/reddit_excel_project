Workbooks.RefreshAll was working on Excel 2010, but now freezes on Excel 2013

Edit; Sorry, had the wrong command in the title. Can't edit now.

I have an expense report template where I use a macro button to update exchange rates to current rates. The rates are on a different tab where I have web sources to keep the data current.

Before I had a macro which used
    
    ActiveWorkbook.RefreshAll                

This was working fine before, but now everytime i run it in excel 2013, it hangs up.

However i can go through each connection through the excel menu data>connections and manually refresh the connection individually without any issue.

Any ideas here? Workaround? 


-------------
I've just did some more trouble shooting. I have a total of 5 connections. 

If I try to update each individually within VBA it works. I progressively added one more each time to try to find if there's a specific connection causing the problem. Based on what I can see, I can update any combination of 4 connections, but the moment I include a 5th it hangs up.

So this works:

    Sub Macro1()
    '
    ' Macro1 Macro
    '
    
    '
       ' ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection1").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection2").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection3").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection4").Refresh
    End Sub

This works

      Sub Macro1()
    '
    ' Macro1 Macro
    '
    
    '
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection1").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection2").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection3").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection4").Refresh
    End Sub
But this doesn't
    
    Sub Macro1()
    '
    ' Macro1 Macro
    '
    
    '
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection1").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection2").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection3").Refresh
        ActiveWorkbook.Connections("Connection4").Refresh
    End Sub
