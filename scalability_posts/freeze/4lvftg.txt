Is this possible on excel? (Freeze panes question)

Hey there, so is it possible to freeze different panes depending on which row in excel you are on?

For example, the freeze pane option let's you freeze the first (let's say two) rows/columns and you can scroll down loads of times without the freeze pane changing. What I want is to have a set of panes frozen for the first ..20 columns? Then a different set of panes frozen for the next 20 columns, then a different set of panes for the 20 after that? So the panes that are frozen will change depending on how far along the excel sheet you are - is this possible?


Thanks in advance!

Short answer, no.

You might be able to rig up a macro to detect screen movements, and constantly be changing the freeze area, but would be tricky. First problem I see would be the "transition areas", when you're going from one group to the next, how will XL know which setting to use.
-------------
Have you considered using split screen view? You can then freeze both screens separately.

Well excel would know which columns you are viewing I would hope!

So like if you got a table and the first column is fixed then you scroll along and another table is beside it, can the fixed panes change when scrolling past a certain point on table 2? (Where the labels are in table 2)

I believe it does this, to a certain extent already. When you select a cell within an XL table, and scroll down, the table headers will replace the default a/b/c headers. Is that what you're wanting?

This only works if your data is in a "Table" in excel.
