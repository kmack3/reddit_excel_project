Big SQL data dump - Extract date range to column headers of a new sheet.

I pull about 150k rows of data and each row has a date tag. I am tasked to create a report that shows the data by date. 

Ideally, I would like to extract the date range and order it newest to oldest as column headers on a new sheet. From there I can index match the rest of my data back in.

This request could include differnt sized ranges in the future, and I will have to refresh it many time for a given time frame. Thoughts? Should I just pivot it?

I just used a pivot. I would prefer to not use one because the data is refreshed on demand. I have to link the pivot cells to another sheet them do my indexing and sorting. (3 separate sort criteria ;top30 for 3 different groups) 

I not really a fan of using pivots this way, I only really like them for analysis, anyone have any comments about another method or reassure me of this one?
