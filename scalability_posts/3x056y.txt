How big a deal to temp agencies job offers would it be. If I learned how to make databases in excel?

Right now am on a temp assignment and am being cross trained how to make an excel referential database from scratch. 

Is this skill marketable by itself, or rather something that is a minor task in most office jobs that temp agencies might have?

It would be a bigger deal if you learned English.

This is correct. I'm about to get a huge raise and promotion to work, mainly, with excel but someone without my other experience couldn't get a job like mine. 

Excel may eventually open the bedroom door for you but it's unlikely to open the front door for you.

Thank you for the useful feedback.

¿Sí , que tan bien sabe usted español ?

*Downvoting? It's worth a comment explaining why.*

I'll say it: Irrelevant, inaccurate, and impertinent comment. Downvoted.

Right now am mostly working on servers, but they would like me to have a knowledge on sql and excel databases they use so am being walked through it all.

The bedroom door? Apparently I need to meet the girls you date.

FALSE, you do not need to know english to be logical.

EDIT: grammar error

Don't forget disrespectful!

It's not worth a comment. I couldn't care less why you're downvoting.

If you have the opportunity, you can parlay your Excel and your SQL, and pick up the bones of Access pretty quickly.

> que tan bien sabe usted español

Means, do you know Spanish.

I think I [covered that](https://www.google.com/search?q=impertinent), but thank you for the confirmation!

I thought Access was only used by College classes these days, with companies using other programs?

Two of my last three jobs, I used Access extensively.

One of them, we needed a tracking database for incoming packages; I created a database app in Access that kept track of all possible addressees, and we scanned their names from a listing, then scanned the USPS information from the package. Access spit out a listing (just report) of incoming packages to hand to the bean counters upstairs, and automatically sent emails to each recipient, telling them that they got X number of packages. Then we scanned the packages out to the recipients, which let us send second and third reminders to people who had been notified, but hadn't come down to pick up their boxes.

The other, I created an inventory database for PC parts for our repair facility. Access has a premade inventory db, but I was given different requirements that wouldn't fit with that example. Access kept track of stock levels for parts, and sent us reminders when stock levels got too low.

If you need a program that does something, and can't find the money in the department budget to purchase it, sometimes you have to make do with what you've got, and it looks good to management to be able to hand them reports giving them exactly what they're looking for, with no additional expenditures (except for your time).

Hmm, I will have to think on that.  Am at a uncomfortable crossroads were I enjoy buying/reselling items from places to make nice bit of cash, but also want to get into IT. The problem am always facing is that I never seem to actually get hired to something that is IT but rather something that is a technical position for a department that is a liaison towards I.T.
