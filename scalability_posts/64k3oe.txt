Big Cells, Small Text: Format to Print Issue

Hi Everyone.

This issue has been plaguing a workbook that my team uses to monitor all of our companies outstanding liabilities. The problem is that when we work with the spreadsheet the text is small and the cells are large. When we print out the workbook the text is extremely small but there is clearly room within the cell to make the font larger. 

Pictures are in the link below:

Couple things that confuse me:
1) Text size if 16 but prints at a much smaller size
2) Margins are set to "narrow" but it prints "wide"
3) Print area is correct and only shows the info I want printed.
4) Adding additional columns makes the text even smaller

Any help would be greatly appreciated!
