I have a big database but I only need certain rows & columns. Is there a way to filter out the columns/rows which I don't need?

Hi everyone,

I have a big database of information for a whole county but I only wish to look at certain areas. The information covers ~600 areas but I only need ~100. 

Is there a way I can get excel to remove the data that I don't need. For example I want to say to excel delete all columns/rows which don't contain the phrases "greenwich 001, cambridge 005" etc.

At the moment I'm doing it manually comparing it with the things I need but I need to do this for 5 spreadsheets and it's very tiresome.

Thanks for any help you can offer

If it's not temporary,  you can save a custom view (I think that still exists) create a view that displays everything,  then create additional custom views to display whichever rows/columns you desire

If you are looking for a way to do it in just a spreadsheet, and not using vba, I would create a lookup sheet of the 600 areas in question.
You could easily do this by copying the column in the data base that has areas to a new sheet. 
Remove duplicates.
Then indicate which areas are to keep or delete in the next column.
Keep the original 600, because you will never know when something changes and you need to add, or change areas that are desirable.
Something like,

Col1      Col2


area001   k


area002   d


area003   d


area004   k


area005   k

Do a vlookup from the sheet you are wishing to clean the various area's.
You will have a new column of k's and d's.  
Filter the data for the k's.
Copy that data to another sheet (the reason to do that is never destroy your original data, you never know when you will need it.)
Next work with your new data and do what you do.
This would be easily automated.  See fantasmalicious.

You could do this exact thing with Power Query for Excel. When you create a connection to the database, you could write a little SQL script to include just those rows or, use the PQ UI to manually filter out table rows based on text criteria. It would be helpful to know what version on Excel you're using and a bit about the database/table you're querying. Possible to do this without PQ, but it would be a little more technical by creating a database connection with a SQL script.

If it's a one off thing, you can just apply filters and delete rows

Otherwise, if this is a regular thing you need to script in some VBA.

The in between of /u/epicmindwarp's suggestions would be adding a helper column you can filter against, rather than clicking all of those little check boxes. One way to do this is a vlookup against a single column for the table_array argument. For example, 

    =VLOOKUP (lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

Where the lookup_value is the cell in your big data that contains the area name, the table_array is your list of 100 areas to be kept, col_index_num would be 1 since you are looking at column 1 of 1, and the range_lookup should be FALSE for exact match.

Once this is done, you can filter off your #N/A values and you're set.

Is there any way to save a filter selection?
I've found a work around where I can use a filter to get rid of rows and then transpose into a new sheet to delete the columns but this still involves me unchecking all of the entires which I don't need in the filter tab.
Is there a way to import a filter selection?
-------------
You can record a macro of yourself applying a filter and just run that whenever you want to replicate those actions.
