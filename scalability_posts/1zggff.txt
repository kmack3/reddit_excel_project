I have a big column of numbers 1-100 that i need to normalize into groups and convert into text strings 1-5,6-10,11-15, etc. What's the best way to go about this?

Why not sort A-Z and then group using cut and paste?

You could try [something like this](http://i.imgur.com/o33Bpzp.gif), maybe.  Basically just building out a table to normalize and then lookup.  Not too much work and you can sort, build PIVOT tables, etc.  [Spreadsheet](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28254/Normalize.xlsx), if it helps.  Good luck.

Sounds like you want to make a histogram type chart.

That's more or less what I'm doing now. I was just wondering if there was a way to do an auto-replace that would take care of most of the labor for me. Thanks though!

Auto-replace? What do you mean? 

Can you send a print screen of a before and after? I don't know what you mean by grouping and text strings in this case.
