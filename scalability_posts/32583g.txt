Need one minor big of help with cell colors

I have a log that keeps track of training certs.  These training certs expire after a few months. I wanted to know how I can program a cell to compare the date in the cell to the current calendar day and if theyre equal to change the color of the cell to red.

Thank you


Haha no idea how to express it but id like to do 

if cell equal today then fill color red


-------------
Go to conditional formatting. Go to New Rule. Go to Use a Formula. Type this:

=[cell with training cert exp date] >= today()

Don't forget to set the format you want.

OK thanks!  I'll give it a try.

OK! So thank you for the reply. This method works but I have like...... over a thousand cells I have to code like this. Is there a way I can highlight all the cells and apply this rule to them?
-------------
When creating the formula, be sure it isn't locked. For instance, make sure the formula says =A1>=today() instead of =$A$1>=today(). If it's like that, you can just copy that cell and paste formats to any other cell you want and it should work.
