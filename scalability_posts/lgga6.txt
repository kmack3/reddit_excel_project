I have two big sets of numbers; how can I easily divide one by the other?

I'm writing a lab report and I have two big sets of data: one for distance and one for time, and I'm trying to divide the distance set by the time set to get a whole other set of numbers (speed).  Is there a formula I can use to easily do this?  Or do I have to do it one by one?


-------------
When you copy and paste cells in Excel it will automatically change the target data. For example, if you have distance in column A, and time in column B, make C1

* =A1/B1

If you then copy C1 and paste it into C2, it will automatically paste

* =A2/B2

This way you can easily paste the formula all the way down as far as you need to. 

You can even click and drag from C1 to C500 to highlight all the cells, and paste the formula into all 500 cells at once.

I hope that made sense.


-------------
Please note that excel cannot handle numbers that are longer than 15 digits.  Enter 123123123123123 in a cell that is formatted as a number and it will display all 15 digits.  Add a 1 to the end.  It will round.  To circumvent this, please enter ' before the number.  This will tell Excel to treat is as text, and allow numbers that have more than 15 digits.
-------------
Once you type =A1/B1 into cell C1 you can you double-click the fill handle so Excel will auto fill the whole column(s) of data instead of you pasting all the way down.

Yes! This is exactly what I needed; thank you!
