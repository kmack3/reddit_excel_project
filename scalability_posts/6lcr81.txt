How to change how big excel window is on screen when you open a new spreadsheet?

Windows 10, office 2016. 

Lately when I open a new spreadsheet it opens up full size but like one cell size from the top of the screen instead of just being flush against the top. When I drag a spreadsheet to top of screen to take up whole screen, a new spreadsheet will take up the whole screen, that's fine. 

When I drag a spreadsheet to the left or side and it snaps to take up half the screen, when I open a new spreadsheet, it'll be the whole screen again but not flush against the top.
