Could use some help on organizing a big project. Involves workbook with multiple sheets & linking 20+ charts to PowerPoint (details inside).

Hi /r/Excel,

Long time lurker, first time poster. 

I'm in the process of building a report for a client. This report will be updated weekly by me. The report is about 15 PowerPoint slides with 2-4 charts per slide. All the data for the sheets is spread across 10 sheets in the workbook. 

My goal is to be able to edit the data in Excel & have it automatically update the charts in PowerPoint.

**Question:**

- Are there any tips or things I should know about when linking data like this? 

- Will I run into problems by having so many charts & data spread throughout?

- How would you tackle this project?

- Best way to update all the charts at once? Currently I have to go through & click refresh data on each chart.

Thanks! I'll be around to answer any questions.

When I used to update charts on s regular basis I would have 2 sheets.  1 was my current report.  The other was where graphs would pull from.  So you update the graph sheet and the graphs the. Update.

Just to make sure I'm understanding you correct. You update the charts in Excel then just copy & paste the updated charts into PowerPoint?

That's how I would do it.   I'm sure there is a way to link them but I wouldn't be able to help there

You can definitely link Excel charts to PowerPoint but for me, I'd always choose to take a snapshot then use VBA to paste that thing into PowerPoint. It just seems too easy to raise errors with so many linkages. Plus, VBA does all the work so you don't have to do anything, other than updating raw data in Excel.

~~You cannot link Excel workbooks to PowerPoint. You can insert an Excel object into PowerPoint but that would make more work for you. The best solution is to copy from Excel and paste into PowerPoint.~~  

Edit: I stand corrected! I did some research, tested it and you can link an Excel sheet to PowerPoint. Sweet!
