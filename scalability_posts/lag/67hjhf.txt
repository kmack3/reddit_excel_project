iferror + Index/Match causing some tremendous lag

Hello,  

I have a sheet that pulls an employee keycard # from a list that our office admins upkeep.  I use index/match to find the number from the first and last name in the first two columns.  I got sick of the #N/A error whenever someone's name showed up, so I plugged in 'iferror'.  That did the trick, but the workbook has begun to run incredibly slow ever since.  

> {=IFERROR(INDEX('keycardnumbers.xlsx]Active Directory'!$A$3:$D$3000,MATCH(A2&B2,'keycardnumbers.xlsx]Active Directory'!$C$3:$C$3000&'keycardnumbers.xlsx]Active Directory'!$B$3:$B$3000,0),1)&"","")} 

For context, the keycard numbers workbook is set up like...  



Number | First Name | Last Name
---|---|----
12345 | John | Doe

Is 'ever since' the same as 'since I closed the other workbook'? 
-------------
Yes. Both workbooks closed out and re opened.

 Maybe I'm misunderstanding what you are trying to do,  but why is your index referencing 4 columns(aren't you just trying to return the key card #)? 

I would suggest connecting to the key card table with data connections (refresh on open), and adding a helper column(combining the first and last name columns) to speed things up.

If you set it up in [PowerQuery](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Merge-queries-Power-Query-fd157620-5470-4c0f-b132-7ca2616d17f9) it will run much faster and can be run without the other workbook being open.

Yes. Both workbooks have been closed and re opened.
