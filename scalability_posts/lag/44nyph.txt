Glitch or Lag in excel

I am having an issue that is really bugging me with Excel. If I mouse left-click grab the top part of excel and move the document around (circle, back and forth, etc), it is like delayed or something. Basically, it doesn't move smoothly with my mouse as literally every other program does if I do the same thing. 

Does anyone know how to fix this?

Thank you.

This just  started happening to me last month at work... and I can't remember how I fixed it. It turned out the mouse was lagging all the time, it was just more noticeable in Excel (how often to you need to accurately click and drag a big square in other programs?) so it was a mouse issue not an Excel one. I think I changed my mouse pointer speed to be one notch faster, and it went away.

It might also help to turn off the animations (Ease of Access if Windows, there's a checkbox for unnecessary animations) or through the Registry there's a DisableAnimations flag you can set in OfficeXX.

wow awesome!  Thank you.  Weird how everything else works just fine except for Office though. But I turned the DPI up on my mouse and boom!

Thank you
