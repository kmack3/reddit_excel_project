Severe input lag in Excel 2016

Hello all,

I recently purchased Office 2016 to use on my personal computer. Prior to this, I'd been using 2001, but have worked extensively with 2010 and 2013.

Since installing it, I have encountered an issue unique to Excel in which the framerate in the spreadsheet window drops significantly. This does not occur in the toolbars or any other open windows. The issue is unrelated to entered data and will occur on blank documents, with text as well as cursor being up to 3s behind input and rendered at 1-10 FPS.

I have tried disabling animations as well as auto-calculation with neither having any effect. Excel runs at <15% CPU usage and around 50MB of memory usage. I am running Windows 7 Pro x64. My hardware is:

* CPU: AMD FX-9590

* RAM: 32GB DDR3-1600

* VGA: Dual SLI Nvidia GTX-680s

* Office install drive: 1.0TB WesternDigital Caviar Blue

I have had issues with graphics acceleration in AutoCAD due to my slightly outdated video cards; is there a way to adjust hardware acceleration in Excel?

Do any of you have any other ideas as to what might cause this and how I might fix it? This problem is really pretty debilitating for Excel, and MS's support hasn't been much help.

The info posted on [this page](http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-excel/windows-10-upgrade-has-made-ms-excel-unusable/3188cff1-afed-4a45-9ea0-8f806bb113d1) may be useful step for you to try.

Try going into Excel Options > Advanced and Disable Hardware Graphics Acceleration. I recently also went into ease of access (WinKey + U) and go to Use the Computer without a Display and checked "Turn off all unnecessary animations (when possible)".

Doing these two things helped speed up Excel quite considerably.

Reading that thread, none of the suggestions seem pertinent to me. My install is brand new, and obviously, none of the Windows 10 issues are at play here.

I don't have any Office updates to roll back from.

Well, I was able to turn both of those off, but neither had any effect. I'm stumped.

Does Excel have its own resource manager so that I could see what part of it is doing what at any given time?
