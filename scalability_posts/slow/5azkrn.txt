Slow nagivation when using ALT shortcuts

Hopefully someone here can help me.

Sometimes when I use the Alt shortcuts to navigate to something I want to do Excel does it real slow, and I will see all the letters for the different options slowly appear, followed by whatever letters I had pressed after. So, for example, if I am doing an auto fit on a column, hitting Alt-H-O-I takes an extra second or 2 after I enter the keys for it to happen. Does anyone know how to reduce the time excel takes?

If it matters, I am using Excel 2013 on an Intel i5 3320M CPU with 8GB ram with a 7200rpm HDD.
