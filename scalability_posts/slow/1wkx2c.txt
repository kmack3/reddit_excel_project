Is there a way I can slow down a data pull off of a server with a macro?

At work I pull massive data sets from our server and it takes a while for excel to chug.  Sometimes the pull fails because I think there isn't enough RAM on my computer (They aren't going to give me a new computer).  Is there a way I can write a macro or something to maybe slow down the pull so the computer can pull easier without failing?


-------------
How and from where from is the data being pulled?  This almost sounds like a timeout issue where Excel quits waiting for the server to return the information.  With SQL calls, there should be a way to set the timeout larger than the default.

Look into 'DoEvents'.

Like /u/user699 asked, we need more information on how the data is being pulled.

Is it possible to make separate pulls? Maybe Date ranges? Is it a loop? 

It may be possible, but not without a little more information.

It is being pulled from a ODBC Database.

Are you using ADODB?  If so, you probably have a line that is similar to:

    Dim con As New ADODB.Connection

You could try:

    con.CommandTimeout=300

before executing the query.  The default looks to be 30 seconds.  This would give it five minutes.  

Not really sure if this is your problem, but it's worth trying.

EDIT - This is assuming you are using VBA to pull the data rather than using an add-in of some sort.
