Last-item (instead of standard first-item) lookup formula is too slow - help?

{=INDEX(B:B,MAX(ROW(A:A)*(--(A:A="tail-end Charlie"))))}

I see "--" used in a lot of formulas here. What does that do?
-------------
FWIW, Excel 2007.
-------------
The arithmetic operator *minus* forces Boolean values TRUE/FALSE into numerical equivalents -1/0, but we need +1/0 so a second - is put before the first.
-------------
Would you get the same results multiplying the true/false by 1?
-------------
I expect so, but haven't tested it in many circumstances. +0 should also work and addition/subtraction uses less cycles than multiplication/division.
