slow

Forced to upgrade to 2013 at work. Now VBA runs extremely slow. Tried disabling hardware graphics acceleration. Any ideas?




-------------
You can turn ScreenUpdating off at the beginning of the macro and back on at the end.

    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True

The only issue is if it gets stuck in the middle, then you need to reenable screenupdating manually, or throw it into some error loop to watch for that.

I would look at the system requirements for Office 2013.  If your system has 1 GB (RAM) or less, you are going to run into an issues, or more so a slow down... 

It is a huge increase from previous systems which are 2003: 128  2007/2010: 256

So to check your ram, click on your start button and right click "Computer" and go to Properties.  This should tell you much ram you have installed... 

If you have 1GB or less, tell your boss you need a better system.

On that same note the requirements say: 

> Graphics hardware acceleration requires a DirectX10 graphics card and a 1024 x 576 or higher resolution monitor

So now is the time to pressure your boss into getting you a new system!

THANKS EVERYONE!  It was re-calculating after every change. 
-------------
    application.calculation = xlcalculationmanual

then at the end

    application.calculate = xlcalculationautomatic

This stops all the cells in all open workbooks being re-calculated once a change happens in any other cell.

This actually makes my macros super fast compared to how they run without screenupdating off. Its a great tip.
