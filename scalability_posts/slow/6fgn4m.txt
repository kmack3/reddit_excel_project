[Google Sheets] Does importing a range from file A to File B, slow down File A?

Let's say I have File A and 25 other workbooks are importing data from File A, would that slow down the original file?


Would it help if I created a middleman file? 

  File A --> File B (Data only) --> 25 other files 


Also, does anyone know of a resource that shows formula efficiency? I would love to know which formulas are actually faster than others.

Google Sheets runs on remote servers and only displays locally. Well, with the exception of offline mode in Chrome OS. That makes it very difficult to measure formula recalculation time.

There are some general rules, common to all currently supported spreadsheets. VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, MATCH are all faster against sorted ranges and using interval matching. FIND is faster than SEARCH, but not so much that it'd have much impact until you'd need thousands of formulas. In array formulas, IF(A,B,IF(C,D,IF(E,F,0))) is faster than ((A)\*B)+((C)\*D)+((E)\*F).

Thanks. One of my coworkers has a pretty large sheet where they have to manually enter in data from pdf or paper. The document is getting slow and I know of at least 4 other pretty large sheets that are pulling information from this sheet. I'm trying to figure out if there are ways to speed up the doc but I'm running out of ideas.
