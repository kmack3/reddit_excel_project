Excel Calculation Suddenly Slow...verrrrryyyyy slow

I have my finances on a sheet in excel that calculate my expenses and future expenses for years to come...it is very detailed.  This isnt the first time it has happened to me.  Every time I just make a new sheet and the problem goes away.  I use the same data including formulas.  For some reason, it just suddenly decides to take 10 minutes on calculating one time.  Any suggestions before I remake my excel sheet?

thanks

We need to know what type of formulas you're using. Arrays? SUMPRODUCT? Is your file bloated in anyway? Do you have a range of unused cells that your file actually things is used?
-------------
try reducing the number of formulas, or the complexity of the formulas if possible.

> for years to come...

are you using today() a lot? Some formulas like today() and the indirect function are recalculated constantly. It's helpful to have one today() at a1, and then all the other cells reference a1. Or better yet, just type in the date at a2 and have all cells reference that. 
-------------
All I'm using are like:
=C1200+D1200+E1200+F1200+G1200+H1200+I1200+J1200+K1200+L1200+M1200+N1200+P1200

or

=Z1196-W1197+Y1197

check your name manager (formulas -> name manager). you can accidentally create named ranges that can junk up a sheet. the fact that the issue goes away when you start over in a new workbook make me think it's related to this.
-------------
Also, conditional formatting will make your sheet slower, if you have a lot of that it could hurt.

Ran into something similar, I forget what was causing it, but it basically thought the last cell was the *actual* last cell, even though it may only have been like K456 it thought it was XFD1billion.
  
Check this guy out to see if resetting the last cell does the trick: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/244435

Cool

Try copying and pasting the table into a new worksheet and use that one. See if it's still very slow. 
-------------
No, not using anything like that
-------------
Are the values in those cells themselves formulas?
-------------
You can simply a lot of that doing SUM(C28:P28)  rather than C28+D28+E28 and so on.

Also, all that formatting eats memory in Excel.  Set the main space to no background color.

Delete any blank space below your table to the bottom of the worksheet just to be sure it is cleared out.

If you have any complex formulas,  add an IF to get out early.  For instance, if you have a complex calculation, but if say a specific value is missing the calculation will always be zero then do a =IF(MyCell=0,0,ComplexFormula)  this allows the formula to op out of the calculation when it doesn't need to be done and will reduce overhead.  Now, for summing a couple numbers, this is pointless, but if you have a crazy formula with vlookups or a lot of complex math, this will help.

Tried this...wasn't this case.  Thanks anyways
-------------
Did this and it worked!  Usually, I remake the entire worksheet. Not sure if I ever tried to copy and paste it before - probably because I'm so OCD, I like to "re-do" things like this to catch any mistakes I may have made prior.  

Anyways, it works now.  Thanks!

What do you mean?
-------------
Glad to hear it. Sometimes it could be due to a whole slew of reasons, so it's easier to just take the data out of there instead of fixing each individual issue. You can reply with solution verified ya know ;)
-------------
In your above formula. are those cells themselves formulas too? Like is C1200 a formula, or D1200, etc.? 
 
Also, do you do a lot of filtering?
-------------
No filtering.  I posted a image of a "formula" I commonly use within the excel sheet.
-------------
So I have a "balance" column.  That column is calculated from another column which contains the total amounts of multiple columns.  

C1200+D1200+E1200+F1200+G1200+H1200+I1200+J1200+K1200+L1200+M1200+N1200+P1200 (An example of an "total amount")

Z1196-W1197+Y1197 (an example of an "balance amount" which uses a cell with the formula above.
-------------
Has it always done this, or did it start recently?
-------------
My initial guess would be a memory leak somewhere, likely caused by your workbook getting more sophisticated and records being added over time. If your other worksheets in that workbook have any lookup functions, even if they never change, you could definitely experience degraded calculation times.
 
You wouldn't notice it for a while because up until a certain point Excel doesn't demand that the system stop everything and recalculate. The more formulas you add, the more calculation Excel thinks it needs. The presence of advanced formulas, even ones that don't change as a result of changing something elsewhere in the workbook, can still make Excel stop and redo everything.
 
That may also explain why redoing the workbook temporarily removes the issue, since Excel isn't soaking up so much of your processor when you run a clean table. That's a pure guess, though.
 
The only good way to combat this is to Paste As Values over any cells that have a formula but don't need to recalculate. If possible, can you check if pasting a significant portion of your formulas As Values removes the issue?
-------------
Just started... I've been doing excel sheets like this for years...every now and then, just randomly it would lag for ten minutes or so (literally) and I would have to "re-do" my sheet completely, using the same data and formulas I already have.  It gives no problem after I redo it.  I am good to go again for another 4-6 months or so after but am getting tired of having to do this over and over again
