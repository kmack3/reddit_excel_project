Spreadsheet with linked photos slows down to unusable.

I am using a macro to read a *.jpg filename from a cell and then display that photo.  Another macro then resizes the photos.  The problem is after about 20+ linked photos around 3mb each the excel spreadsheet becomes lagged out to the point that it becomes unresponsive.

I don't think the macros are to blame because if I delete them, save and re-open the document the lag is still there.  I'm thinking Excel is probably not the best medium to display lots of large photos but I cannot find a comparable macro for Word that will read a photo filename from a table and display the corresponding photo.

The two machines we are trying to use this are less than two years old with 8GB of RAM each.  I can post an example of the spreadsheet or marco if needed.  Please help.

Post the macro you are using.

As far as having the picture appear next to the text, you can either just use a vlookup and avoid the macros; [Like this](http://trumpexcel.com/2013/11/picture-lookup-in-excel-using-named-ranges/). Or you can cut down the macro to something like this:

    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim oPic As Picture
    Dim cl As Range
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Me.Pictures.Visible = False
    For Each cl In Range("B1:B25")
        For Each oPic In Me.Pictures
            If oPic.Name = cl.Text Then
                oPic.Visible = True
                oPic.Top = cl.Offset(0, 1).Top
                oPic.Left = cl.Offset(0, 1).Left
                Exit For
        End If
        Next oPic
    Next cl
    
    Set oPic = Nothing
    Set cl = Nothing
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    

    End Sub

After that, you can just add the little piece of code to adjust the picture size.

Thank you for your reply.  While this looks useful it does not address the issue of many photos lagging the spreadsheet.  Even without macros the spreadsheet becomes unresponsive after 20+ photos are linked.
