slow

Looking to make an Excel worksheet with lots of vlookups and pictures - how to go about it effectively so that the workbook is not super slow

Hello,

I am looking for a basic work book that has the following sheets:-

1.) Sheet one has basically two columns, Color Code, Picture of that color

2.) Sheet two has two columns , Design name , picture of that design

3.) Sheet needs to have the following :-

Design Number

Color Number

Color Code

Color Percent

4.) All sheets till now were used to store data. This one will be used for result display only. I need the following results :-

Design Number  : XXX (dropdown from sheet1 or 2)   [Display Picture pulled from sheet 2]

Title  **Color Number  //   Color Code    //  Picture of Color**

**Result :** Pull from sheet 3  // Pull from sheet 3 // Pull from sheet 1

Repeat as many times as the color number in sheet 3

(Explanation : a design can have 1 color or 20 colors, if 1 color display info about that, if more than 1 colors then display info about all of them)    


I know just enough excel to make it work, but I am worried that when there will be 1000 pictures then the excel will become extremely slow. Is there anyway to overcome this problem ? Or any other solution to it ?

Excel will just fall over. It's not built for this. Have you considered Access instead? It's perfect for this task. 

If you create tables in access that mimic the way you have your sheets described and then have a single query page you've nailed it. It shouldn't take more than an hour to make. Also, if you want to be really fancy create another view to add data i.e. new designs, colours etc.

I agree 100% that access is better suited to the task. My problem is, this workbook needs to be accessed at 5 different locations. With excel I can easily share over google docs, is there something similiar for access ?

In that case stick to the native Google Docs Sheets as it can be queried likue a DB. I would host on the cloud a query a sheets doc querying the sheets holding your information using the query () function. It uses Sql like syntax. Personally I'd keep my sheet querying the data as a separate file and have data links to the sheers holding your data.  

Edit. Excel is not the solution here unfortunately.

hmm... don't really know much sql. Guess I have my reading list set for the weekend
