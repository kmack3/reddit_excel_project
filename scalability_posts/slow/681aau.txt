Slow to Cut and Paste, not slow to Copy and Paste (Text) - Excel 2013

Not a big deal, but a fix would make life that extra bit more pleasant. 

On my main Excel worksheet, which has many many tabs, many hidden, and is mostly text based - but ultimately has a lot of data on it - whenever I copy and paste it happens immediately, but if I cut the same basic text (a single cell for example) and then paste it will take 10 to 20 seconds before completion. 

I've experimented with a very small worksheet and the issue does not exist. 

Just a matter of it being a large worksheet and having to live with it?

Maybe the cell you are cutting is being used by formulas. So when you cut it, Excel recalculates (check the status bar below the worksheet right).

Try putting excel on manual calculation before cutting and check if it gets better.

Tried it, same thing, but thanks
