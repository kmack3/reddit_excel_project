Hi 


Copy > Copy Picture > As shown when printed is painfully slow with a network printer set as the default.


When printer is set as a local printer there is no issue.


I believe the cause of this is that when using the above copy the printer drivers have to be loaded (which takes time when you have  network printer)


Can someone confirm this for me (I can not find anything on the net)


Thankyou

So same printer and same driver works fine if set as local, e.g. LPT1? Or is it that it works when your other (local) printer is default?
