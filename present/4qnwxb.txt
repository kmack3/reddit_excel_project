Is there a way to speed up the "Paste Values"? Why is it so slow?

Hello,

I have a column A that contains 80.000 rows of 10 digit numbers. Most numbers occur only once. Some occur more than once (up to 70 times). Column B should show me how often the number has already occured. To calculate this I used this Formula

=COUNTIF($A$1:A1;A1)

It works pretty well and the calculation just takes a minute or so for the whole 80.000 rows. The strange thing happens when I try to copy and paste the rows of column B as values in column C. This took more than 1 hour. 

Is there a way to speed up the process? Does anyone know why this could take so long?

Some background:
The rest of the workbook is completely empty. No conditional formats, volatile formulas or pivot tables. My excel 2013 64bit is running on a virtual PC on a windows server with 32gb and a lot of processing power.

So if you think about what the formula is doing, the first row checks 1 cell, but the 80000th row checks 80000 cells. In between, the number of cells adds one each row. 

Remember how to sum `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n`? It's `n * (n + 1) / 2`, so that's 3,200,040,000 comparisons --- this is going to take a long time no matter how you approach it. 

u/hrlngrv has the best advice -- approach the problem differently by not doing so many comparisons.

*COUGH COUGH* Use a PivotTable?....

I think you need to turn your calculation mode to manual (in Options), paste and then go back to automatic mode...

You have 80K values in col A, COUNTIF formulas in col B, initially nothing in col C, then you copy col B and paste-special as values into col C.

I've noticed paste-special as formats triggers recalc.

FTHOI, if cols A and B are in A2:B80001, try entering =B2 in cell C2 then double-clicking C2's fill handle. Is that fast? Then select C2:C80001, copy, and paste-special as values. Does that also take 1 hour?

Anyway, your col B formulas use a very slow algorithm. Time for an old-fashioned mainframe-like approach. Assuming all columns other than A are initially blank.

    B2:  1
    B3:  =B2+1

Fill B3 down into B4:B80001. Select B2:B80001, copy, paste-special as values. Sort A2:B80001 on col A in ascending order. Excel should maintain col B order for multiple equal col A values.

    C2:  1
    C3:  =(A3=A2)+1

Fill C3 down into C4:C80001. Select C2:C80001, copy, paste-special as values. Select A2:C80001, sort on col B in ascending order to return col A to its original order. You'd have the instance numbers as constant values in col C. Clear col B if not needed further.

copy/paste column b into notepad, select all, paste into column c, hurrah!

I would understand if the calculation would be slow. But the calculation is actually pretty fast (a minute or so). Also if I copy column B and paste all the formulas to Column C, this happens basically instantly. It´s pastingthe values what isso slow...

I´m sorry but I do not understand how this helps my problem... 
-------------
I´ve tried that. No positive effect...

The PivotTable will condense all the unique values in the ROW field and then you can use the VALUES field get a count of how many times they occur. Avoiding the formula route all together and making use of an object that was designed for such aggregation activities.

While it's running the paste special, press CTRL-BREAK - is there some kind of macro running?
-------------
Thanks for the tipps. Unfortunately no. No macros.

Can you use macros? If so the following will write the values of column B into Column C

    Sub copyColVal()
    
        ActiveSheet.Columns("C").Value = ActiveSheet.Columns("B").Value
    
    End Sub
