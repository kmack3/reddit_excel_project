Best way to fit a big table in one chart?

Hi,

I'm wondering if there's a way to show the table with total count for each stages plus the total net revenue in ONE graph/chart? Or do you think the simplest approach is to make two charts instead? I tried creating different graphs, but the numbers are way too cluttered.

Please see link below.

I appreciate all the help!

Thank you!

I have a similar issue where I have potentially 21 "clients." The issue is the data point will span from tens of millions of dollars for some clients and tens of thousands and possibly even zero in certain periods. There was no way to visually see anything without making two graphs. Yeah, you can adjust your start and end scale values, your variables, and more, but the data just doesn't work well together. For us it works, because I can present as X group of lower "clients" and Y group of higher "clients," because we're familiar with them and they have a common area for the most part. I'd just have two thresholds. You have some wide variances. That's my 2Â¢.
