slow

Pasting a range into a table is very slow - why?

* a large range.  Pasting a range of 100 is instant - pasting a range of 4,000 seems to almost crash Excel.  

Full setup, if it matters. 

Workbook 1 has a sheet with several thousand rows (in a range)

Workbook 2 has a sheet with a pivot table, that points to a table on another sheet in Workbook 2. 

When I copy and paste the range from Workbook 1, into Workbook 2's table, things freeze up and almost seem to crash.  The data gets there, but it's slow. 

My point in setting things up this way, was so that I could point the pivot table at tables, rather than ranges - and thus every time I use this template, the pivot table would automatically grab all the data, without me entering in the data range manually.   Somehow adding a range of any length to the table, is very slow though (which kinda defeats the purpose). 

Any idea what's going on?  Is this just an Excel limitation - copying very many rows into a table, is inherently a slow operation? 

Thanks,

Be more concerned with if your workbook has bloat or some sort of corruption I do some 400k++ on 32-bit with Excel and experience what you're saying but you shouldn't be dealing with that at just a few thousand. If you transfer this setup to a brand new workbook - paste as values and then recreate the table and PivotTable see if you have the same issue. 99% of the time you can't see issues like this but they just exist and a brand new workbook can make a world of difference.

Huh, so the plot thickens - you're right, doing this same operation in a new workbook, the range copies over into the table, no problem. 

So it's something else in the workbook.  Which is another issue so...
