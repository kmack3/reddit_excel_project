Excel lags when switching sheet tabs or copying cells

Even copying just about 20 cells and pasting into another sheet will lag for 3-5 seconds. It blows my mind because I'm sitting on 32GB of RAM and a decent processor (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4820K CPU @ 3.70GHz)... Never had anything lag my computer until now. My formulas are very straight forward. Just a row of =PRODUCT formulas and some columns of =SUM formulas. But nothing too extensive. Any idea how to fix this? 

The lag is not so bad if I copy the cells and paste in the same sheet, but copying cells from one sheet and pasting to another sheet causes extensive lag.

I noticed it lags every time I come back to the sheet. So if I am on chrome and click into the excel sheet it will lag. Or going into another sheet, it will lag. Every time I return to the sheet it will lag for 3-5 seconds.

You could try setting the formula calculation from Automatic to Manual. Once you've made your copy/pasting you can click "Calculate Sheet".

Do you have conditional formatting in your document?

most likely you have a bunch of cells that use something like =OFFSET() or =INDIRECT() or something. I learned recently that if you don't switch calculation to manual that these cells will recalculate any time you do basically anything, even if you're not changing cells that they reference. 

ordinarily, supposing you had something in cell A1 that was like, =A2, then A1 would recalculate only when A2 was changed... but if it's one of those two functions I listed, then it will recalculate any time anything happens anywhere in your workbook pretty much.
