Excel crashes after using vba Copy/Paste operations for large data set.

Hello All,

I am have issues with using vba to copy and paste a data set. So the data set consist of 5000 rows and about 15 columns. The rows are data that belong int he same groups where the first column is the ID of each row data. I sorted the rows so all the same ID are grouped together (e.g. rows 1-10, rows 11-50, rows 51-200 are the same ID). 

 I wrote a script to add a row onto a transition in an ID number as I scan down the first column (ID values). Then I will copy the header row of the new ID row and paste it onto the newly added row.

My problem is that if I use a data set of 200 rows it may do this 20-50 times and finish with no problem. However when I attempt to do this for my real data set of 500 rows it eventually crashes (greys out) and the windows screen appears.

my vba code is below:


Sub InsertM(i)

Sheets(2).Cells(i, 1).EntireRow.Insert

End Sub



Sub Sort()

Dim i, N, b As Integer, colsize As Integer


N = 2 'sheet of interest
b = 2 'inital start of data


Sheets(N).Rows(2).EntireRow.Copy
    InsertM (2)
  Sheets(N).Rows(2).Select
   Sheets(N).Paste
   
   Cells(b, 2) = " "
   Cells(b, 3) = 0
   Cells(b, 4) = " "
   Cells(b, 5) = " "
   
   Cells(b, 10) = 0
   Cells(b, 11) = 0
   Cells(b, 12) = 0
   Cells(b, 13) = 0
   Cells(b, 14) = 0
   Cells(b, 15) = 0
   Cells(b, 16) = 0
i = 3

Do While IsEmpty(Cells(i, 1).Value) = False


   If Sheets(N).Cells(i - 1, 1) <> Sheets(N).Cells(i, 1) Then
   
    InsertM (i)
   
   Sheets(N).Rows(i + 1).EntireRow.Copy Destination:=Sheets(N).Rows(i)
   
   Application.CutCopyMode = False
   
   Cells(i, 2) = " "
   Cells(i, 3) = 0
   Cells(i, 4) = " "
   Cells(i, 5) = " "
   
   Cells(i, 10) = 0
   Cells(i, 11) = 0
   Cells(i, 12) = 0
   Cells(i, 13) = 0
   Cells(i, 14) = 0
   Cells(i, 15) = 0
   Cells(i, 16) = 0
  
   
i = i + 2
Else
i = i + 1
End If
Loop

End Sub

There is only ONE circumstance I've identified where I had to use copy/paste and you don't have it!  Never use Copy/Paste to move data around in Excel.  Each time Copy executes, it moves data into the clipboard.  Each time Paste executes, it moves the data from the clipboard to excel.  This means you are moving the data twice to achieve the desired result and in the process churning up all of the available scratch space on your computer.  You are filling up the scratchpad which causes Excel to CRASH!

One thing that may help is to clear out your temp folder.  The Windows version you are using and how it is configured may affect where it is stored.  If you need help to figure out where, post in the PC forum and someone can show you how.  Figure out where it is located and then delete all the files you can, some won't delete if they are in use.  It is usually in Users.<YourUserName>.AppData.Local.Temp on Windows 7.  There is a similar location on other versions.

The first method is to use a Range object for the move.  Yes, a Row is a Range object in the Excel Object Model.  Note in particular the use of the "Value" on the end, this is required.  If you play around with this, you will find ways to transfer cell formatting if needed.

    Sheets(N).Rows(i) = Sheets(N).Rows(i+1).Value

The second method is to use directed copy.

    Sheets(N).Rows(i+1).copy Sheets(N).Rows(i)

Another suggestion, don't set all those cells to " ".  I won't tell you how, but there is a much better way to put either a space or to clearcontents.

This sometimes happens when you're trying to copy a lot of cells and your computer doesn't have the available resources.  Instead of trying to copy and paste the entire rows, choose only the cells with data and copy those.  This should fix it for you.

Perhaps it's inserting rows, copying/pasting, too fast/too much for excel and it locks up? The code looks ok, I don't see why it would create an infinite loop. You could try adding an application.wait somewhere in the loop. As well as DoEvents somewhere in the loop. Can't hurt anything.
