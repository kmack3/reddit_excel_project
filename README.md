Use get_random.py to get random posts from the /r/excel subreddit

Use search_term.py to scrape the top 100 results from search term results. Note that this checks for duplicates and makes sure they are not rescraped.

After running search_term.py, run get_aready_pulled.py to copy the names to the already_pulled.txt file.

already_pulled.txt is a list of the ids of all of the posts that have been scraped.
