Mac Shortcut - Freeze panes

Hey,

 I just moved to a startup and It's a mac shop. I'm still doing basically all excel work, and obviously it pains me to work in excel on a mac after losing all my shortcuts from a PC. 

I've mostly adapted, but I can't find a shortcut for freeze panes. How do i do this?

Alt + W + F + F?
