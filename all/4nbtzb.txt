I have data on one sheet I need to sort one two sheets big-small, small-big, automatically. Can this be done without macros?

So we use a big generator for a lot of weekly data. We get all the data on a sheet X. This information is not in any order since it changes weekly. We then need to report the top and bottom 5 for each week. The only way we do this is by copying the data, sorting manually, and then posting. Is there a way to take the data on X and automatically sort it on two separate sheets, one big to small and another small to big? I never used macros before so I'd prefer not to.

Do you need to sort it for any reason other than to get the top and bottom 5 of each week? If not, you can use an array formula to grab the 5 largest and 5 smallest from your original data. There are good tutorials you can easily find on google if you search "find K smallest values in list" and "find K largest values in list".

It looks a bit much, but it's not too bad once you understand the functions it uses. I believe they use INDEX, MATCH, and SMALL or LARGE, and then dragging it down to 5 rows and using Ctrl+Shift+Enter to make it an array formula. 

If you need data from more than one column for each row you grab, then you can just use INDEX/MATCH or VLOOKUP to get the other columns for each row.

Just the top and bottom 5. I will try looking up some tutorials to see if it works. Thank you!

Here's the formula for the top 5:

    =LARGE(A:A,1)
    =LARGE(A:A,2)
    =LARGE(A:A,3)
    =LARGE(A:A,4)
    =LARGE(A:A,5)

And this is for the bottom 5:

    =SMALL(A:A,1)
    =SMALL(A:A,2)
    =SMALL(A:A,3)
    =SMALL(A:A,4)
    =SMALL(A:A,5)
