Will Excel be used forever?

Where do we go to make sure Excel will continue to be used as an object based analysis tool? Will Excel ever go extinct?


-------------
Someday our sun will die, and with it will go Excel.
-------------
I don't think it will go extinct anytime soon, but it's probably a good idea to save important files in csv format just in case. 
-------------
Before Excel there was Lotus 123, maybe a few other spreadsheet programs pre-excel too.  Spreadsheets will never die, because the learning curve isn't too steep and capabilities are pretty high.   
-------------
Only things I can see replacing it anytime soon are statistical packages like SAS or SPSS, but those guys carry the downside right now of being insanely expensive. R is free, but designed for other stuff.
 
If Microsoft decided to give Access more of Excel's capabilities to manipulate data rather than just store it, that *could* do it, but only for customers with large data samples.
-------------
I could envision a very user-friendly database program that functions like a spreadsheet.
-------------
Excel does not get enough credit-  it's the greatest thing that Microsoft has given the world.  People that worked on the project have said the code base is one of the best around, and the team that built it was brilliant.

And think of everything it does:  You can prototype lots of different things in it-  it powers just about every business on the planet.  It can be used to manage things, compute complex models, shed light on data and even play video games.  I have used it for 20+ years, and I am still a novice and I always will be.
-------------
MS are not going to lose interest in Excel, and Office in general, since they still make pretty good revenue from them, especially within the business world.

That may change one day - as others have noted, Excel was not the first spreadsheet application, and it probably won't be the last.

Maybe one day Google will dominate, and we'll all be using Sheets :(
-------------
I think the future of data analysis will be something closer to IPython but more user friendly (I.e. none coders can get by). As far as self service BI goes, I'm a big believer of Tableau.
-------------
I remember about 8 years ago our IT manager said we had to learn how to use Open Office Calc because they were not renewing Excel licenses and would be getting rid of excel company wide.

I thought it was a joke and they were freaking crazy.

Sometimes IT has no idea how much excel and other software they deem too expensive is being used.

Guess who renewed excel licenses?
-------------
Anyone that just uses Excel for it's speadsheet capabilities can get by with Google Sheets. Excel is alive for a few reasons. VBA\VSTO is one of the big ones, effectively making Excel a platform. And MS has added power pivot, and power query in recent years to make Excel act closer to a BI tool than ever before.
-------------
I would bet that it eventually dies out in favor of stronger programming languages, this IMO wont happen for a long time until essentially programming is a common thing taught in HS... Which will probably be like 20 years
-------------
Or a nuclear holocaust, where only cockroaches survive, but their budget will be all screwed because they will no longer have Excel.
-------------
I think I found my epitaph. Or at least work desk quote.

this is the best comment I've read all week

I'm scare that three people might have thought you were serious.

and probably best to back them on on 3.5 inch floppies, just incase the internet and the last 15 years of technology go away.

In the beginning was Visicalc.

And because there is a benefit in some instances to seeing the data right in front of you as you work. Maybe that's part of "learning curve" but for me one reason I prefer dumping results into a spreadsheet is just the ease with which I can see and manipulate them without writing any code.
-------------
Lotus 123 was the shit. I loved playing on that as a kid. 
-------------
I still have a copy of 123 on my Windows 8.1 machine just in case.

Actually I use it once in a while because I like the way it does multivariant regression analysis better than Excel.
-------------
Access is actually pretty good at manipulating data, it just takes longer to do so it isn't as flexible for ad hoc reporting.  A lot of my monthly stuff runs through access first and then I just suck it out into excel for formatting and manual adjustments.
-------------

SAS and SPSS are designed for other stuff as well. Probably the most important factor of Excel success is that it makes extremely easy to create table. People are using Excel (or spreadsheet app in general) every time they need table. Nobody is using SAS or SPSS when they need a table.

See first part of [this blog post from Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2012/01/06.html), Program Manager in Excel team in early 90s.
-------------
sheeeet.
-------------
Large companies aren't going to be willing to put their data in the cloud, where Sheets lives. Too much risk. Unless Google comes out with an offline version that will allow the data to be stored on and not leave an internal network, it's not going to be a replacement.
-------------
Offtopic but, I recently came back from a 2-day training course on Desktop Fundamentals and already, it amazes me what tableau can do at its most basic level, compared to replicating the same features on excel (which is much more complicated).

I can see tableau becoming a world-wide standard software for creating dashboards and visualisations
-------------
Officially on my whiteboard above my desk
-------------
.... sooo.... .txt then?
-------------
Tsv = tongue separated values? Time saver virtue? Text seems villainous?
What does it MEAN?!
-------------
Time to get out the Zip and Jazz drives!
-------------
 and Bill and Steve saw that it was good.
-------------
I kept track of soooo many baseball cards in Lotus 123 on whatever computer my mom and dad deemed obsolete for their business in 1988. Also, Space Invaders.
-------------
With the inclusion of PowerPivot and other relational database functions within Excel; I would have thought the push would be to place more database/Access functionality into Excel, then push SQL Server Express as the first step towards dedicated databases; or re-package SQL Server Web Edition into one of the upper Office suites.
-------------
Not unless they make it much more flexible. Right now making bigger project in tableau is awful and difficult to menage. Not to mention very limited communication with tableau server. Also tableau is much more expensive than excel.
-------------
I was thinking good old pen and paper
-------------
T-separated values, duh. All values in this format are separated by the letter T.
-------------
And Diego felt old because he used both.
-------------
It's the size of the original data file.  The millions of records can't be handled by Excel unless you write the pull in MS query which I do have some do.  It's just easier and quicker to do it in access.  I've also noticed that in these later versions of excel it has developed inconsistent glitches.
-------------
You make a good point. I had tableau installed on my work PC for a few months and had a go trying to figure some things out by myself. 

I found the software to be less intuitive than Excel and it was until I had to be physically taught by an expert, I finally managed to grasp a basic understanding of tableau's interface.

But having said that, imo it really is a powerful tool and is definitely worth more than what it is currently selling licences for.

I haven't had the chance or the knowledge to construct large projects so I can't give a response to that yet :P
-------------
It's not like big projects are any easier with Excel. I mean for bigger stuff you are much better off with a Microstrategy or an Oracle BI solution.
-------------
ah.. yes.. we could do t-test analysis with those files
-------------
Well, that make perfect sense! Just so long as we never need to store a value containing T...
Come to think of it, how do csv files store commas within values? I've never actually looked.

Edit: I assumed that /u/cassius_longinus was joking. That assumption appears to have been invalid. I don't know how to feel about life, now.
-------------
Have you used any other BI platforms? I found Tableau to be the most intuitive.
-------------
I submit data to the Fed and they request the data in a .txt as L delineated values. We have to make sure we don't submit comments with L or else the upload process errors out

Either entire field is enclosed in double quotation marks or comma is escaped by proceeding backslash. There is no real standard here.

By the way, comma is commonly used as decimal separator in European countries, so "European CSV" uses semicolon to separate fields. Yes, it is still called "CSV".
-------------
I haven't! Have you? 
-------------
I've demoed a few others, MS BI, Domo, and Anaplan.  Really liked Tableau.
