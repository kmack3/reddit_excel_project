Macro-enabled workbooks super slow to open after windows update?

Just wondering if anyone else has run into this and may have a solution.

Windows pushed an update yesterday, and when accessing some files today I noticed that some took a lot longer to open.  Specifically, it seems like macro-enabled workbooks are the ones that are super laggy.  It took excel 2.5 minutes to open a 230kb excel workbook, whereas yesterday, it would open no problem.

Spent an hour on the phone with MS support, no solution.  They did have me create a dummy profile and open it from there, and it opened right up.  The techs response was that my original profile must have gotten corrupted so I should just move everything to the new profile...  That just doesn't sound like a solution to me.  Anyone experience the same thing?

Im running Office 2016 (64, but tried with 32 and same issues)

I would appreciate any insight!

Have you attempted to copy your VBA modules and data over to a fresh workbook to test the corrupted file theory?
