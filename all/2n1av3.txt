[HELP] Trying to Freeze both columns and rows. Looked it up, won't work the way it was described.

I am using Excel 2013. Trying to freeze a few columns and a couple rows at the same time.  I can achieve either one or the other, not both. Any help?


-------------
Unfreeze the panes.

If the row divider or column divider bars are deployed, clear them.

Select a cell, for this example, use C3. Select Freeze

You have now frozen the top 2 rows and left 2 columns. The cell you select in the previous step will be the "upper right" cell in the unfrozen area.

EDIT: Oops. I mean your other right.
