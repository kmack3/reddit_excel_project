mailmerge with photos - excel to word documents (big challenge)

i have a problem.

so i know want to create a booklet of contents in word. 

i have all my information ie. countries, company names etc. in a table in excel. i want to extract them into a beautful template in word. one issue is that i want to put the flag of the country next to a mailmerged item "country".
since the flat of the country is an image and it will float on the top of the box in excel, i cannot mailmerge it into word. is there a way i can put the image into a box so that excel can recognise it as an item inside the box so that I can merge it into the word document? otherwise does anyone have any idea how i can approach this problem??

thanks!

You can't lock a picture into a cell, unfortunately.  You should still be able to note what country the flag is in, though, in a column.

In Word, you can find a way to find/replace the text with the flag.  Here is a website describing how to accomplish this with Windows Explorer. http://techwelkin.com/replace-text-with-image-in-ms-word

Try looking at Catalog Merge, in Publisher.
