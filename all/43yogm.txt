Need help/suggestions on transferring a large Excel Spreadsheet to a Microsoft Word Document!!!

Hello Reddit! I hope you all are having a wonderful night. 

I have been having some issues transferring a large excel spreadsheet to word. By large I mean 16 columns by 42 rows, and I may even have some larger than that. This first table will help me get a hang on how to do it for the upcoming ones in the future!

Does anyone have any tips on how I can transfer this, while keeping it professional? This table should be formatted in a way in which it could be published in a peer reviewed journal article. I have tried multiple things including inserting it as an image, creating a table in Word and pasting the data, but I would like to find a way to make the table readable on Word, if possible.

Can anyone provide me with any tips?!

You can usually just select the range in Excel, copy, and paste into Word.  Not sure if this is what you mean when you say

>creating a table in Word and pasting the data

Still, editing the table to make it look right in Word is a pain. No matter how well you have it laid out in Excel, Word always seems to edit it to its liking.

Also, this is a decent gif.  Obviously a lot of this is people's opinion, but figured it might be helpful: http://i.imgur.com/ZY8dKpA.gif

Thanks for a prompt response!

I do appreciate the gif. It did help, but an issue I failed to mention in the original post is that within some of the data cells, there is a lot of text. 

In all hindsight, I do believe that I need something like provided below (should download a .pdf file). The biggest difference is that I have 16 columns as compared to the 4 provided in this example. I am looking for a way to paste something like the table provided into a word document, or even create a pdf similar to the one provided. Do you have suggestions? Thank you for your suggestion, it did help me!!

Quick question! When looking at the gif you provided, it said to reduce white space. Is there a quick/efficient way to do that without having to manually drag each of the row borders?

When we have large tables from excel that have to go to word we tend to insert -> section break ->next page then page format -> landscape , add the table on the landscape page then another section break then set the format back to portrait.

Yup, you can typically click the "Select all cells" button (the top left corner, left of A, above 1), and then double-click on row or column borders.  This will fit all rows or columns to the right width.  Just be careful with it if you have long strings that you don't want to show all of or when you have wrapped text, as that makes things a little funky.  Let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you for the suggestion! I was also planning on placing the table in a landscape format. I do have a few questions about that: 

1. How do I make it so that the page numbers are continuous after changing a few to landscape? 

2. Do you have suggestions on how to make the table look nice when there is a large amount of text within certain cells?

Hmm... What version of Excel are you using? I am using Excel 2010 for Windows and I don't quite understand what you mean by "double-click on row or column borders." I don't see that on my screen.

Also, I should have clarified, but what if I have already inserted the table into word? Is there a way to remove white space quickly when the table has already been inserted?

Thank you for your help!!!

1) click in the footer and right click on the page number - in the page numbering option there's a continue form previous section box, tick that. 

2) wrap text and make the cells as few lines as possible, you can use alt + enter or char (10) to add a hard line break in excel if it makes your formatting nicer.

Ah, sorry.  When in Excel, the edge between, for example, column A and column B, where you click and drag to resize.  If you double click there it will auto adjust to fit whatever the widest thing is.

If it's already in Word I'm not very sure.  I don't work in Word often, sorry :(

Sorry for getting back to you so late, I would have sworn I posted a response last time, but I might not have submitted it..

I now understand how to re-size the column width. Thank you!! My next issue is how do I make it so the height of the row is minimized? There are times where a row will have maybe one line of text, but has a ridiculous height. Is there a way I can fix this to make it so there is minimal blank space? Thank you for your help!!

This is an example of what I am struggling with. I want to reduce the amount of blank space in the width of each row, but have been struggling. Can anyone help?! You all have been very helpful so far!!!

Same way we adjusted column width. You can click the box above 1 and left of A to select all cells, then on the border between any two rows this time, just double click and it will auto fit all rows to be the proper height.
-------------
So I tried doing this, but it only adjusts the row that I click. It seems like I may have to do this individually for each row...... Is there a way around this? Or am I just not doing it correctly?

Actually I take it back, I did not click something you instructed me to click. I got it now. Thank you soooooo much! You were the biggest help, forreal.
