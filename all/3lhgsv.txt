freeze

Simple freeze panes question: can I have the entire first row (1:1) and the leftmost seven columns (A:G) frozen?

I want the data in the leftmost columns to stay put while I scroll through a large number of rows that start with column H. I'd also like the top row to stay put. I though I could do that in older versions of Excel, ending up with a 'T' split/freeze that ran horizontally between rows one and two, and vertically between columns G and H. But can't figure out how to do that in Office 365. Am I missing something that obvious or is there a trick to this?

Sure.  Click in H2 and freeze panes.

It's on the View ribbon, in the 'Window' group.

Contrary to what others have said here, I don't think you can do this with just "freeze." In my experience, you need to click "split," which should be a separate button on the same ribbon. That will give you your "T" split.

I'm not at a computer so I can't test the other suggestions. 

**edit:**  I'm also using Excel 2010 and 2013.  I don't know about Office 365.

Freeze panes is Alt, W, F. 

Do the same for unfreeze.

There are 3 freeze options

Freeze Pane - Freezes all visible rows/columns prior to your selected cell.  This is what he wants.

Freeze First Row

Freeze First Column

Yep, you're right.  I was mistaken.  Thanks for showing me that.
