Freeze Selected Cells to Keep From Scrolling Right and Left

Is there a way in Excel to freeze a row of cells to keep them visible when scrolling horizontally? A macro maybe?

Edit: For context: I have a lot of data that is spread out horizontally and would like the header to stay visible while scrolling horizontally through the data.


-------------
If they are your top row, then you can just click in the cell 1 right and 1 down and then on the view tab, click freeze panes and select freeze panes.

Otherwise, I don't know.
-------------
Given

 | A | B | C
---|---|----|----
**1** | Ttl | Col1 | Col2
**2** | Row1 | R1C1 | R1C2
**3** | Row2 | R2C1 | R2C2

If you make cell B2 the active cell then freeze panes, it'll freeze all col A and all row 1, so that if you page down and right you'd see

 | A | D | E
---|---|----|----
**1** | Ttl | Col3 | Col4
**4** | Row3 | R3C3 | R3C4
**5** | Row4 | R4C3 | R4C4

That's the most you can freeze at a time: a range of cells in the top-left always on screen, column(s) on the left which remain on screen as you scroll right but scroll as you scroll down, row(2) on the top which remain on screen as you scroll down but scroll as you scroll right.

Thanks for all the replies!

Right but that only freezes when scrolling up and down. I'm looking to freeze it when scrolling left or right. 
-------------
That'll freeze your first column, so that when you scroll right, I'll still show you the first cell in each row.
-------------
It'll freeze everything above and to the left of your selected cell when you freeze them. You could do 5 rows and 10 columns or more. Doesn't matter.
-------------
Right but I'd like the header to be above the data and not at the top left of it.

Edit: Freezing a row that does not move when scrolling left or right.
-------------
I'm sort of confused. If you have a header in the first column, when you "Freeze Pane" by selecting the cell directly underneath the header, your header won't move when you scroll horizontally. 

If you don't want the entire row to move (ie: you have multiple headers and you want none of them to move), I'm confused as to why you would want to do that. The headers are relevant to the data in the column underneath it, so they *should* move when you scroll right or left. 

If you just want a single header to be centered above all your columns, move the header text to the middle of the worksheet before you freeze panes.

If none of this answers your question, I am afraid I need to see what you're talking about, because I'm not following what you're trying to accomplish here. :P
-------------
First off, I have a complicated boss. Basically the header I'm speaking of is just like a title of what the table of data shows. He wants it so where when you scroll horizontally through the data, the header (title) stays displayed above.
-------------
Do you mean something like when cell A1 is the active cell and at the top-left of the screen the title would appear to be in cells C1 to H1 and you want that title to remain on screen as you scroll right? Even when columns C to H in rows below the title scroll off the screen to the left you still want to see the title in C1 to H1?

If so, not possible in Excel except through macro trickery. You could use a SelectionChange event handler and a drawn object with the title. As you move the cell pointer to the right, the event handler can move the drawn object with the title to keep it at the top of the screen, but it'd wobble. Also, if your boss scrolled the window using scroll bars, that wouldn't trigger the event handler, so it wouldn't move the drawn object.

So no ___robust___ way to do this in Excel.
-------------
So if it's basically a title, there's two options I'd suggest:

1. Actually use the header functionality you have your worksheet: you can have Headers and Footers at the top and bottom, outside of the actual data and tables in the cells. On your ribbon, go to **View** --> **Page Layout** (in the **Workbook Views** group) and you'll see three header sections. Use the middle one to put the title in, and keep the file in "Page Layout" view. Page layout view is not compatible with Freeze Panes, so if you *also* need to freeze panes, then move on to:

2. Have the Title in your first column, and freeze the first column. You won't be able to centre it above the table, though. You can't freeze just cells, only Rows or Columns. I experimented to see if merging & centering the cells in your title row would work, but it doesn't: it'll still only shows what's in that first column, so a centred title won't show up. But you'll at least have a visible title no matter how far right you scroll.

If it *must* be centred, use the Page Layout option. If not, use option 2. If your boss is getting particular about you coming up with a solution that requires essentially custom dev (and even then, I'm not convinced it can be done) because they "prefer" it visually, then you should push back and let him know that's not native Excel functionality (and then provide alternatives and give a recommendation for one of them - this works 95% of the time! I promise! I use this as my guiding force: Don't tell someone you can't do something, tell them what you *can* do instead. People appreciate you coming up with solutions and are normally happy that you've come up with something). Like, thats a demand for a ridiculous amount of work for minimal (or non-existant, IMHO) benefit.

Honestly, I can't fathom why having a title in the top-left (with bigger font, and maybe a different font or fill colour to make it pop) wouldn't be an acceptable finished product. lol.

Good luck!!!
