Using Data Queries. "Refresh All" freezes Excel, but refreshing each link does not. What's happening?

I'm trying to scrape data off of NHL.com for a fantasy league and I have excel set up to Data Query about 65 web pages. When I click Refresh All (or even if i try to refresh 3 at a time), I get "Unable to open http://www.nhl.com/stats/playerblahblahblah. The hyperlink cannot be followed to the destination". 

However, if I try to refresh each connection **1 at a time** or **2 at a time**, they work. Obviously, I'd prefer to make this a 1-click operation rather than a 100-click one. Why isn't it working with Refresh All?

Some background info:

* How often you will need to do this task. 

    * Once per day at least.

* Which version of Excel you have. (Windows/Mac, 2007, 2010, 2013, etc.)

    * 2013



* What you have tried already, if anything.
    * Deleting the web queries and remaking them. (I go to Data/Get External Data From Web/ then navigate to the web page http://www.nhl.com/stats/player?fetchKey=20152ALLSASAll&viewName=summary&sort=points&gp=1&pg=1 and click "Import".)
* General skill level with Excel. (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, etc.)
    * Beginner, I guess? Maybe Intermediate?
