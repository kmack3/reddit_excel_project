How can I prevent Excel from rounding up large numerical strings?

Hello, I'm trying to parse a numerical string using text columns. The parse splits the string into two pieces: a 17 digit number and a date. However, my version of Excel is rounding the 17 digit number and I'm losing the original string. Does anyone know why this is happening and I can avoid this?

Excel only works on numbers 15 digits or shorter. 

So whatever cell you're writing the value to has to be formatted as text or you'll digits at the end will become 0's.

The source is a csv file from Facebook.  Here's an example of the string I'm trying to parse:

10153989090333960_03/02/2016
