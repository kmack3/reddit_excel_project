[Excel 2013] Seeing daily Excel crashes, event logs are ambiguous (ntdll.dll related), does anyone else have these issues?

Hi guys.  For the last few months I've been having increasing crashes of Excel.  Anecdotally they seem more common when I have multiple Excel windows open.  It shouldn't be a memory issue, these are modest-sized spreadsheets and I'm running 64-bit Excel with 16gb RAM.

Here's the event log from the most recent crash:

Event Generated: 3/27/2016 1:01:13 PM

	EventID    =1000

	Source    =Application Error

	Faulting Application Name    =EXCEL.EXE

	Faulting Application Version    =15.0.4805.1001

	Faulting Application Timestamp    =56c43cf4

	Faulting Module Name    =ntdll.dll

	Faulting Module Version    =10.0.10586.122

	Faulting Module Timestamp    =56cbf9dd

	Exception code    =c0000005

	Fault offset    =000000000002fe34

About 80% of the errors reference ntdll.dll, the rest reference KERNELBASE.dll.  I haven't had any luck googling ntdll.dll or error codes.  I've updated/repaired/reinstalled Office, the problem persists.  Not using any add-ins. 

**I also have less frequent crashes of Outlook, though no crashes of Word/Powerpoint**.  This is really frustrating, I've had to tweak office to autosave every few minutes to prevent data loss.  Anyone have and solve similar issues?

Thanks much!

Does your sheet have any macros/VBA?

Is it pulling in data from other workbooks?

Some do, but I've replicated the issue with only sheets without Macros/VBA open.

No. I just sucked it up and turned autosave to every minute
