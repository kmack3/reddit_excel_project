Pasting Error when trying to paste large number of rows from 2 columns into master column

I keep getting this error: "The information cannot be pasted because the copy area and the paste area are not the same size and shape"

I have googled everywhere. I don't have any merged cells. I don't have any grouped columns. One column is near 40K rows and the other column is near 14K rows. I want one master column of all 54K rows but keep getting error. 

Using most recent Excel for Mac. Downloaded 2015.

Thank you!



-------------
Select 1 cell in the range that you want to paste instead of the entire row or column.

If you want to paste the first 40k, select A1 (or whatever) Paste.

Copy the 14k

Select A40001 and only A40001

Paste

Have you tried pasting it into a completely new sheet and see if it gives you an error?
-------------
Got this error just today. I think it's just too many rows (though I was at 65k)
-------------
To clarify-

Columns A and D are my lists that I want to merge into F.

I don't understand "Select 1 cell in the range that you want to paste". After I select, do I copy and paste to F? Then it will only paste 1 cell.

Please explain again and thank you! 


-------------
It will paste 1 column but not both as 1 merged column.

Post a new question! 

If you're using Excel 2007 or more recent, save as XLSX instead of XLS to get beyond the 65K limit.
-------------
you cannot copy 2 columns and paste them into 1 column.

That's exactly what the error message means when it says "not the same ... shape"


/u/fuzzius_navus has suggested the correct solution: copy one column and paste it then copy the other column and paste it below the last row of the first paste (by "Select 1 cell" he means select cell F1)

so the steps are:

* select A1:A40000
* copy
* select F1
* paste
* select D1:D14000
* copy
* select F40001
* paste

Thank you for expanding on my comment. This is a much clearer analysis of the OPs question.
