How would i freeze a sheet of formulas?

Hey, a bit of a different one for you...

I have 3 tabs in a workbook and on my 3rd tab (ignore the other 2 tabs - just wrote for more info) I have 6 numbers that I have written and about 50-60 simple formulas working out things like dates and ££... yes I'm British 

On the last day of November I need to freeze all them formulas, so the number the cells are will never change....

I don't mind if it means moving things over to another tab or anything, I just don't want to get vba involved :) 

What's your suggestions?


-------------
Select all the data you want to freeze, copy it, right click the upper left hand corner of the range of cells you just copied, select "Paste Special" and choose "Paste as Values". That way, you overwrite the formulas and you're left with just the numbers.

I didn't think it would be so simple....

Kind of embarrassed for asking!
