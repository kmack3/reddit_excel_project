freeze

Need to freeze panes, but not at the top.

I'm on mobile right now, so I don't have any screen caps. However, my sheet is set up as:

Information

----------

Headers

----------

Table

I would like scrolling to scroll the information off page (it's about half the screen) and then freeze the headers once they hit the top. I'm open to all solutions, including using VBA.

Unless I'm misunderstanding you don't need to do anything special here. Scroll down the worksheet so that your header row is the top row appearing on the screen, then highlight the row **below** that one, and click "freeze panes". That should leave you with the header row frozen to the top of the window, with everything above hidden out of view.

If you make your 'table' an actual Excel table, this is exactly the experience you'll get once the table header row reaches the top of the window - the table headers essentially replace the `A B C` column labels

Solution verified!

Oh. My god. I didn't know that freeze panes could do that. God, that's useful. I am looking to be able to scroll up all the way, and that seems to freeze it permanently out of view unless I unfreeze, but this is super helpful. 

Edit: actually, I can make this work :)
-------------
Oh nice! Is there any way you know of to do it without using an excel table, or nah?

Solution verified!

In addition, keyboard shortcut is "shift+space bar" to select row, then hit "alt+w>F>F"

Ah, if you're looking to be able to scroll around in both the top frozen portion as well as the bottom portion of the window, try using "Split" instead of freeze panes, not as pretty though.

I've never tried to do it any other way :)
