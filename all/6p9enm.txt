Allowing a second user to access shared workbook causes Excel to crash

**Background** - My company uses a monster of a shared workbook for a lot of inventory and production planning purposes. This workbook contains about 140 worksheets and weighs in at 30 megabytes. We have 4-5 users logged into it daily; some make more changes to it than others. **Yes, I know shared workbooks invite all sorts of problems. We've experienced nearly all of them. But it's been working well for us over the past 11 years.** We're in the process of switching to a new database system, but in the meantime, I have to make this work. 

**The problem** - The workbook was fine on Saturday. This morning when I tried to open it, Excel gave me a glimpse of a worksheet - I could see data - but my mouse cursor turns into the blue vortex of death, and as soon as I click anywhere my Excel window turns a mix of grey and white and the workbook never loads. 

Somehow I managed to get into the workbook through some combination of read-only, open & repair, or other voodoo. 

BUT, now that I've made a copy of the workbook and re-shared it to my co-workers... the file crashes for everyone (upon saving) after the second person connects to it.

Does anyone have any troubleshooting suggestions? 

There are no macros or other VBA, nor are there external links present in the file. It's all self-contained.

Did you try opening Excel in safe mode?
-------------
Try to save the Excel file as new workbook if you can and share it again, if this did not work then try to share it by following the steps in the below video:

I'm able to get the workbook open, and I can even edit / save / share for as long as I want - as long as I'm the only user with the file open. When a second user attempts to open the file, it never loads for them. If I close and reopen while they try to do their thing, then I get locked out and have to jump through hoops to get the file back. 

It's almost as if there was an Excel update to the sharing feature that broke it.
