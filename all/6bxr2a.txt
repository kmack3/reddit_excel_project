Transposing a large table (200 rows, 25 columns) into unique rows with the both row and column data (5000ish rows, 3 columns)

Hi all! I have an excel table and the ultimate goal is a bar graph. The table has 25 columns, which consist of unique locations (office facilities). In the rows I have 200 unique cost centers. The value of each cell within the table is the total number of employees using that cost center at that location. 

After using that to create a pivot table I wasn't getting the format I had hoped for... I want to be able to show a bar chart comparing the cost centers (not all at once so using the filter to sort by cost center or cost center category) by location. So, the x axis would show the locations by name (not the value in the cell) and the y axis would show the number of facilities using that cost center. 

My next thought was to transpose the table so that each row was unique of cost center and location...column A cost center, column B location, column C employee total. Is there an efficient way to do this? 

I apologize for the lack of pictures but it's for work and I can't access reddit on my work computer (sigh). Thank you!!

Without seeing the data, my guess is that you need to unpivot it.
