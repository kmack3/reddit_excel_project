I have a big excel file. Every time I open it I get a different number of rows. Why is this happening? It's ruining my day.

280k entries. Every time I open the file which takes 5 minutes each time it has the wrong number. 


-------------
This is what happens when you try to use Excel as a database.  Use SQL instead, or at least MS Access.
-------------
Does the file contain only constant data? What's the extension? .XLS, .XLSX, .XLSM, .XLSB, something else? How many rows should it have? How many did it appear to have the last time you opened it?
-------------
Is it a shared file or one that only you access?  

Are any of the columns filtered or hidden columns filtered?
-------------
I'd copy the data in to a new file and save it, sounds like it is corrupted.  Does it have a lot of conditional formatting or other formatting or pivots tables?
I've never had a file over 50mb.
-------------
Not sure how much of this applies to Macs.

Make a backup using the equivalent of Explorer on a Mac, don't load the file into Excel and save it as a different name.

Start Excel and click the File tab, select the file that's giving you trouble.

Click the arrow next to the Open button, and then click Open and Repair.

Click Repair.

I don't know if this is the same on a Mac or even non-existent. I think your file XML data is corrupted, but not enough to trigger Excel's automatic repair function - like maybe you have a CR in your XML which shouldn't be there.

If the above fails wait till you load the best version - the one with the most data and save it as an xlsb binary file. Open that and see what it looks like.
-------------
Can you export the data as csv instead of xlsx? There are lots of file splitters that will break txt or csv data into smaller, manageable chunks before processing.
-------------
Too many enterprises are too cheap to provide Access via Office Pro rather than Office Standard. Far too many white collar workers have nothing but Excel and MS Query for database-like projects.
-------------
I've never seen this and I have spreadsheets with almost a million lines in them.
-------------
xlsx. only constant data. its a 250mb file so its just a big one.
-------------
Only me. No filters active or hidden anything. I'm on a mac if that matters 
-------------
+10,000 - more often than not a file this large is at the point of bloat due to corruption. I have 3+ years worth of data appended in some files (mind you it's ONLY data - no calculations etc.) and I'm barely at 4 MB on some things.
-------------
I misspoke previously, the file is a csv not xlsx. I got it to work after opening about 7 different times 
-------------
That is a shame.  Hell SQL Server is free for the single user version.
-------------
Count yourself lucky.  Also do have any idea how much faster SQL server would be for your reports?  You should look into this if you can.  And what are you going to do when you need a database wit 16 million records?  Excel flat out will not accommodate this.
-------------
On a side note, you should seriously consider saving it as an xlsb file, unless you have a specific requirement to be able to parse the XML data.

Saving large spreadsheets in binary format makes for much smaller files that open much faster.
-------------
How many ___rows___ should it have vs how many it appears to have when you open it? How much RAM does Task Manager show Excel is using when the file is open in Excel?
-------------
In the future, split the CSV into 25mb pieces with a script before opening it them. That should be much quicker and you can avoid the row limit.
-------------
IT departments don't want users installing/using any unapproved software regardless of cost.
-------------
I'm using SQL to populate the sheets with only the relevant data *in the first place...* I have *millions* of cells on which I run reconciliation comparisons. I've previously used Access for similar large scale comparisons and it was significantly faster - but my department doesn't like Access apps.
-------------
If you are using SQL to populate excel so you can then presumably generate some sort of output, you are definitely doing it wrong.  Use Crystal Reports or SQL Server reports directly against the SQL database.  Once it is set up you can just schedule the reports and literally spend close to zero time administering an excel database.
-------------
Well it was for a complex data migration project where we needed extremely fine control over sending data updates (using an API via XML which I also wrote in VBA). Excel worked (almost) perfectly in this role -  only struggling when we got into tranches with tens of thousands of records.

Agreed - for a more repeatable application you'd avoid doing what we did with Excel - but the flexibility required meant it was imperative that the data could be visualised and checked prior to dispatch.
