Excel 2011 (Mac) crashes when selecting an add-in

(Unsolved).

Hello everyone.  Excel crashes when I select a new add-in I'm trying use for my training seminar tomorrow.  Everything is up to date, and I'm wondering if it's a security issue that's causing Excel to crash.  


It says this:

-------------
Addin name?

You sure the addin is Mac compatible?
-------------
WSTMacros3.4.4e.xla

I would assume it's Mac compatible, but I'm not sure. Would there be a way to check?
