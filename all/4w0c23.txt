How do I replicate this? Using a better freeze pane like function without using freeze pane

I received an excel template which did a cooler version of freeze pane where my headers became flush with the column letter headers.

Please see the following pictures here:

*note how the column headers become flush with the actual column.   The overall effect is much more visually pleasing than a freeze pane.

This just looks like it's an [Excel table](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Overview-of-Excel-tables-7ab0bb7d-3a9e-4b56-a3c9-6c94334e492c).

Select your data, then go to Insert > Table. If your table has headers, those headers will "merge" with the column when you scroll down.
