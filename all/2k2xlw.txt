I need to take the average of some curves with a large mismatched data range

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/MyhfmDA.png) is an extract from my data. As you can see the numbers in each first column are not the same, which would be ideal. If I shift the cells or take the next closest it would make more sense.
  
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/5fdFuu1.png) is each of them graphed (minus the final two columns - that was my first average when I realised it would not work).  
  
I need to create an average curve somehow, but how can I do this? The columns are extension and force respectively if that makes any difference.


I guess I would use VLOOKUP to match corresponding values, but I'm not versed in VLOOKUPS and I don't know how to do that across 6 sets of data, to return the number I need, and take an average of them all.

Can someone lend some assistance here please?


-------------
How do they not match up? 
-------------
Could you possibly do two average curves? One where extension starts at 0.375 and goes up in 0.125 increments, and one where it starts at 0.45 and goes up in 0.15 increments? 

edit: If that makes sense? I don't really know what you're trying to show or why. 
-------------
In the first row, 0.375 matches with 0.45 and also 0.4125. My manager and I think if we take the values for force closest to each value of extension then we can see how they change together. 

E: Reworded to hopefully make it clearer.
-------------
That is an extract from the middle of my data so unfortunately not. I'm just trying to graph some tensile test results. I have 25 samples that have each been tested 6 times, for comparisons sake I need to take an average of the 6 tests to leave me with just 25 respective sets of data. Then I can plot those in order to compare them all.
-------------
Ah, yeah, I've had to do something like this before.

It isn't pretty.

How comfortable are you with extrapolating data points between two measurements? (would it invalidate the data if you did so?)

If you're open to doing that, I would copy each of the x axis columns, paste into a new, single column, and do a Data->Remove Duplicates. Then sort it.

Then you would have a combination of lookups and extrapolation formulas in the columns beside that new x-axis column.

Depending on how fancy you want to get with your extrapolation, it could be quite simple or quite complex.
-------------
Edit: /u/vertexvortex's idea of stacking all the data is much better! Ignore this post! :D

But you have 3 tests that increment with 0.125 force and 3 that increment with 0.15 per measurement of force, if you can't take the average of each "step", I guess you can't take the average of the .125 increment and the .15 increment averages. Does the graph you linked have Force along the X axis or the observation number? I think it might be a problem if you've plotted it as a line graph instead of an XY Scatter, it is leaving out your extension data. 


is it possible to make some extension categories and then average all the numbers that fall inside of them? 

If you do a setup like this:

Extension | Force | Extension Category | Formula | 
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | 
a | a | 0 | 0 | 
b | b | 0.2 | =SUMIFS(B2:B6,A2:A6,">"&C2,A2:A6,"<="&C3)/COUNTIFS(A2:A6,">"&C2,A2:A6,"<="&C3) | 
c | c | 0.4 |  | 
d | d | 0.6 |  | 
e | e | 0.8 |  | 


Then you could expand it to your whole set of values by putting you 6 extension columns next to each other and your 6 force columns next to each other. 


Sorry if this is a bit rambly, just brainstorming here
-------------
[This](http://i.imgur.com/McteCar.png) is what it looks like when I average down the columns, the graphs goes back on itself. I've tried discounting data but sometimes it cuts the graph rather short if others extended particularly far. So I guess I'm pretty uncomfortable extrapolating it.  

  
I'll give it a go at some point today hopefully and see how it turns out. I may ask you for more help if that's okay?
-------------
The annoying thing is that's not true in all cases, another data set I have open now increments in 0.04 and 0.025.   
  
Sorry I should have labelled it beforehand, X axis is extension, Y axis is force and it is plotted as "Scatter with smooth lines".  
  
What do you mean by next to each other, as in stacked or side by side? As I had stacked them Ext next to Force, except I can't remove duplicates or sort as some levels the force is constant for quite sometime while the extension is increasing, so again I would have some X data without Y and vice versa.   
  
Moreover, due to the changing increments I would have to tweak the formula/extension category continuously for when it is 0.025, 0.04, 0.015 etc, all the way down the column (down to A4502 ...). I could give a blanket value such as 0.001, but that's a bit much. And I'd have to do this 25 times, and another 150 times for the other tensile tests I need to do on the same samples :/
-------------
The extension of certain series is going to be a restriction of current data. The only way to generate any figures beyond a certain x-axis is going to be either: extrapolate or ignore. If you ignore, just don't calculate an average.

Not knowing what you're doing, it's hard to make a suggestion either way, but I would be inclined to not make any sort of measurement that's going to have different number of series halfway through the graph unless you can clearly show that. (maybe just add the average as a new series?)

Regardless, the extrapolation is actually quite easy, to my surprise, when you remember the correct functions.

I have the following source data:

|x|y|
|-|-|
|2.55	|100
|3	|101
|3.4	|102
|3.8	|103
|4.2	|104
|4.55	|105

I then have the all-combined x-axis

|x|
|-|
|2.55
|3
|3.4
|**3.75**
|3.8
|4.2
|4.55

using the `TREND` function I got this extrapolation for the 3.75 measurement.

|x|y|
|-|-|
|2.55	|100
|3	|101
|3.4	|102
|**3.75**|**102.8018433**
|3.8	|103
|4.2	|104
|4.55	|105


(formula: `=IFERROR(INDEX($H$1:$H$6,MATCH(C4,$G$1:$G$6,0)),TREND(D1:D3,C1:C3,C4))`)

This is just using the prior 3 data rows as a known x and known y source. it calculates the next point given the new x (3.75). It uses the least squares method to calculate the trend.
-------------
yeah, the next to each other thing isn't going to work out I think. I think the best option would be stacking everything, then copying your extension increments column only, and remove duplicates of those cells, only. Then try and get the average force of each possible extension "strength" in your dataset. 

So you'll probably end up with a graph with almost twice as many extension measurements as a single one of your tests, but the force values will be the average of the measurements of force for the occurrences of that measurement of extension.

At least that sort of seems to make sense to me. 

If you have your data outputted all in the same way in their own sheets then, once you have a method down, you could probably write (or record) a macro to do the stacking and sorting and such fairly quickly. Just need to find a way of dealing with the data that makes sense first :P 
-------------
i was thinking, since the extension values for his 6 tests progress at two different rates for each set of 3 tests, would it make sense to:   
stack all of his data on top of each-other,   
copy the extension column somewhere else,   
remove duplicates,  
then do 

    =AVERAGEIF(all_stacked!A2:A601,Unique!A2,all_stacked!B2:B601)

That way he'd get the average force value for each of his extension values for the sample in one big column, and then be able to stick that one on an XY scatter?  If  an extension values overlaps (like at 0.75 which both the 0.125 and 0.15 progression will reach but at different speeds), it will still give the average of those values with the same extension, and not use the order of the steps. 
-------------
Yep, these are all the issues I ran into when I was doing it. Finally settled on extrapolating on the missing values. Unfortunately, I did it a stupid way then. I think the `TREND` approach is just too easy to bypass. The only limitation I see on it is if the first few x-axis measurements are missing data, the trend is highly useless. That probably isn't surprising.

/u/OsamaBinLadenDoes if you need help setting this up, please let us know.
-------------
Yes, but for that extension average to still make sense on the overall graph, the average would have to continue all the way down to 0.

And you wouldn't want to change averaging sources partway through, it would just throw off the data. also I think it would throw off the data to use that averageif when the x-axis changes number of series.
-------------
I could do with a little help if that is okay please?  
  
I have stacked all extension in A, and all force in B. Then I have copied all extension to E, and removed duplicates (but not sorted/ordered the data). All beginning in row 2.  
  
I attempted a VLOOKUP like so (sorry for my formatting):  
  
=VLOOKUP(1,$A$2:$B$4496,2)  
  
To output in cell F2. However, all this does is give me a value of 5.12, which is copied all the way down my table. 5.12 is the corresponding force value at an extension of 1. Maybe I have a poor understanding of VLOOKUPS but I had hoped that it would give me the corresponding force value from my unduplicated extension values from the original data.  
  
THEN, I tried using/u/tjen 's formulae like so:  
  
=SUMIFS($B$2:$B$4502,$A$2:$A$4502,">"&E2,$A$2:$A$4502,"<="&E2)/COUNTIFS($A$2:$A$4502,">"&E2,$A$2:$A$4502,"<="&E3)  
  
And hoped that by dragging that down it would follow the unduplicated extensions and give me an average of the forces, however it returns 0 in all cases.  
  
I'm not sure what to do now. A satisfactory but not ideal solution is to just take one typical curve from each of my data files, but obviously the  average would be much better.
-------------
I'm not sure my description would have made sense so I screenshotted what I currently had that was not working. All SUMIFS returned 0, and VLOOKUPS 5.12.

-------------
ok let's take this one step at a time.

(If you want to use /u/tjen's solution, you can avoid some of the work already, since you already have the data set up correctly)

First thing you want to do is generate a single column that contains a unique list of all of your x values.

To do this, copy **just* the X values from a column, paste it into a new column off to the side or a new sheet (*and leave room for a data header!*). Then go copy your second column of X values and paste that underneath the new column. Continue in this manner, stacking all of your x value columns in 1 spot.

Then, go to `Data->Remove Duplicates` on the new, giant column. Sort.

Up until this point, it looks like you pretty much can already get here, given the screenshot you posted [here](http://i.imgur.com/9eEzv7S.png).

Now, tjen was using averageif to generate . You can do that, but it means that *some of your final averaged data points will be taking a mean from a smaller set*. I honestly think that's a bad idea, and bad data representation.  
**Unfortunately**, my solution is also somewhat misleading! (though I believe less so). I was suggesting extrapolating data points where you have no overlap on the x axis.

If you want to use /u/tjen's solution, just use the column directly to the right of your new x-axis column. The `AVERAGEIF` he has suggested will work.

For a slight variation on /u/tjen's method, you could take a... slightly different approach. You can use `AVERAGEIFS` to "bracket" the x values. Like so:

`=AVERAGEIFS($B$5:$B$4505,$A$5:$A$4505,">="&D4,$B$5:$B$4505,"<="&D6)`

What this would do is, at each x value point, average the y values from 3 possible x values. So it's going to be more reliably picking up most if not all of your series. It would also smooth the data a little bit, which can be a bad thing. Honestly I'm not a big fan of this approach either.

So, if you are ok with extrapolating data for points in the series where there is no y value, you would go with my approach:

It looks like you have data 6 series here. Beside the new column, add 6 new headers, named as you wish. (I suggest to the right, as one should! Though it is a matter of preference.) 

i'm going to assume a 3 period trend for extrapolation. It's more responsive to variability, and the value step differences are small enough that it shouldn't matter terribly (it would be an academic exercise at best to really find the best number of periods to use). What this means is *I will suggest you use the previous three x,y value sets to forecast a new value when one of the series is missing an X value*

I'm going to re-use my data from earlier:

I have the following source data for one of the series:

|x|y|
|-|-|
|2.55	|100
|3	|101
|3.4	|102
|3.8	|103
|4.2	|104
|4.55	|105

I then have the all-combined new x values column. (3.75 isn't in the series mentioned above, but it exists in another series)

|x|
|-|
|2.55
|3
|3.4
|**3.75**
|3.8
|4.2
|4.55

using the `TREND` function I got this extrapolation for the 3.75 measurement.

|x|y|
|-|-|
|2.55	|100
|3	|101
|3.4	|102
|**3.75**|**102.8018433**
|3.8	|103
|4.2	|104
|4.55	|105

Here was the TREND function: `=IFERROR(INDEX($H$1:$H$6,MATCH(C4,$G$1:$G$6,0)),TREND(D1:D3,C1:C3,C4))`


-------------
Instead of the SUMIFS COUNTIFS, try just doing (edit: The sumifs countifs was a bad way of doing it to begin with, just ignore that whole post XD) 

    =AVERAGEIF(A5:A4505,D5,B5:B4505) 

and see if that returns something sensible



-------------
I used tjen's approach first, and all the numbers seemed somewhat sensible my graph goes skeewiff. The force obviously drops at the end, so the force will repeat some values but that is a must, as it shows the onset of necking in my samples. You can see the graph [here](http://i.imgur.com/qJQrsOE.png).   
  
Also your alternative using averageifs gives me #DIV/0!. I tried tweaking the formulae to my spreadsheet but it doesn't appear to want to change, Excel also wanted to correct your final " in the equation to "". Although I am unsure why.
  
I'm afraid I don't understand this:  
  
>  It looks like you have data 6 series here. Beside the new column, add 6 new headers, named as you wish. (I suggest to the right, as one should! Though it is a matter of preference.)  
  
What is the new column sorry? I understand I want the 3 period trend but I cant align the extension and force columns to have the force column with a missing data cell. It always compresses the duplicates and forces them to align with completely random values, but if I remove duplicates on the force column it removes even more data, as obviously the force can stay constant for much longer while the extension will either be equal or increasing.  It's rather hard to explain. It'd be easier if I could send you the document to at least fiddle with (please don't feel obliged).
  
For example here is an extract from the first set of data from my first of the 6 sets of results, do you wish for me to put a column to the right of y? Would this column be the duplicates removed version of x? Or should I remove duplicates first, the only issue with this is it compresses the data and I lose corresponding force values.  

  

|x|y|
|-|-|
|0.025	|0.6
|0.05	|0.72
|0.075	|0.8
|0.1	|0.92
|0.125	|1.04
|0.15	|1.16
-------------
That gave what looked like sensible results, however my graph output was [this](http://i.imgur.com/qJQrsOE.png) and I have no idea why. Other than that possibly as the force values decrease when my sample is close to breaking causes Excel to form the graph backwards, but that doesn't make sense as I can graph the raw data just fun and it's in the exact same format. And my extension values are continuously increasing (just as they should be).
-------------
It might be easier to explain if I had at least a subset of each of the data series?
-------------
lol, I have no idea, that looks weird, usually scatter plots lines follow the order of the data plotted, so maybe double-check that it's all sorted, it looks like it might have two gaps or something. But for a real smooth line you'll probably want to just plot the dots, and then do a 2nd polynomial regression line showing the the trend (should be an option somewhere).
