"View" ribbon "settings/formatting"--i.e. gridlines, freeze panes, zoom, etc.--for a workbook unexpected cleared. Why?

So I have a large workbook (xlsb) with many tabs.  All of the "formatting" I did with the "View" ribbon has become undone--no frozen panes, 100% worksheet zoom, and all gridlines are visible.  Does anyone know what could have caused this?  This is more for curiosity's sake than for restoring my "formatting."
