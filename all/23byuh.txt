Variable freeze panes

I am wondering if it is possible to freeze columns A:G and rows 20:35?  So when you scroll right only rows 1:19, columns past H move. 

Excel 2007 autobot.

Is this a very specific requirement or u want to get some job done with this?  I ask bcoz, in case, of the latter you can try split... Or create a new Window so that u can Alt+Tab whenever u need.
