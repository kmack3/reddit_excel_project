Excel crashes when opening a spreadsheet with images referencing a local directory

Just created a sheet with 6000 rows. Ran a macro which added an image to each row. Saved the sheet. Didn't change the file directory or anything. 

Now when I'm opening that file, excel continues to crash.  
I'm using excel 2010 on a windows 10 machine. 
Any help would be appreciated!

6000 images - could be the file size - how big is the file now?
Can you make a copy of this file and revert the original to an earlier version as well?

could be the file size! Seems like Excel just doesn't have the heart to live when files have that many images. I just had to break it up into three sheets and export those as html files to get the images to stay with the information. 

thank for the help!
