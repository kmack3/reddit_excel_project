I think too many nested IF statements is causing my spreadsheet to crash

I've been asked to look at a spreadsheet at work which is used to do pricing estimation. The people who use the spreadsheet find that it just closes without warning or an error message at some point. After having a look at it I noticed there are about 200+ nested IF statements (below) and whenever they add new rows (which they almost always do) it's adding another 6 every row they add. 

My question is, is excel calculating all this whats causing it to crash? (stack overflow??...I did some research and this seemed to be a common result) 

And if it is, is there a cleaner way of writing this equation:

    =IF(F12="",IF(H12="",K12,H12*K12),IF(H12="",F12*K12,F12*H12*K12))

The equations really just multiplying quantity by cost and I feel like there must be a simpler way.

Also, I'll just add, this spreadsheet is on a network drive and people have said when they save a copy to there desktop the sheet tends not to crash as often if at all.

it's probably the network drive. though your formula is redundant because you have two conditions for H12="". As it's written, it stops at =IF(F12="",IF(H12="",K12,H12*K12)

Not sure about the crashing, but you might be able to replace the formula with this:

    =SUMPRODUCT(K12,IF(ISBLANK(F12),1,F12),IF(ISBLANK(H12),1,H12))

Ed: for that matter, just 

    =PRODUCT(K12,IF(ISBLANK(F12),1,F12),IF(ISBLANK(H12),1,H12))

Is it so? If F12 is not ="", the false side of the outer IF should still work.
