Large number problem

I'm working on number theory homework, specifically RSA encryption.  I'm trying to decrypt 

y=5,272,281,348

with

p=187963

q=163841

m=30796045883

k=48611

u=20709535691

so I need to solve

x~y^u mod m

but that's not the important part.  To solve for x I have to multiply large numbers by large numbers, with products reaching 20 digits, maybe 21, but excel is rounding after 15 digits.  Is there a way around this?  I can post the spreadsheet or a screenshot if necessary but I doubt that'd help...maybe theres a different software I should be using for this?

edit:  if i cant get 21 digit numbers, could i have excel calculate the congruences?


-------------
Excel will not work for this application, and I don't think vanilla MATLAB will either. The maximum number of significant digits for 64-bit integers is 18 or so, and less for floating point (as you discovered). 

You need to use a programming language like Java (with the Big number objects & functions) or Python (which automatically transitions to arbitrary big number math when needed).
-------------
You're probably better off using Matlab for this. Excel isn't widely known for its precision with large values.

If not this, something similar.  There are libs to handle this sort of thing.
-------------
[This](http://www.python-excel.org/) seems relevant.
-------------
i've been meaning to get into programming, i guess theres no better time to start than now.  any suggestions where to start?
-------------
Matlab uses the same OS-defined 64 bit floats as Excel, but that's not enough.
-------------
wouldnt install correctly....it doesnt say anything about installing in win7, do you know if its supposed to work?

Or [this](https://datanitro.com/downloadpage.html)
-------------
[pythonxy](https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/) gives you everything you need in one excellent package, and python probably has more tutorials on the web than any other modern language.

It's also got a native CSV reader.
-------------
I don't use any of them, I'm just aware of their existence because I know there are algorithms that specifically address the problem you are having.

thanks, i'll probably try to learn how to use python this weekend
