How to convert large column of hyperlinks into shorter clickable text (they all can display the same text)?

I have a spreadsheet column of different hyperlinks displayed in this format:  https://www.reddit.com/  

I am looking to efficiently convert the entire column into shorter text, while still being clickable.  They can all share the same short text - as an example the hyperlinks in the columns would all read "Click here for link".  

I tried searching for a way to accomplish this, but all I could find was the inverse - or turning short text back to long display of the links.  




-------------
Try this:

    =HYPERLINK($A1,"Click here for link")
-------------
    =hyperlink( cell with hyperlink, "what you want it to display")

This allows you to shorten hyperlinks displayed like www.reddit.com to anything you want such as just reddit or website.
-------------
Yes this is what I want to do - but I also want to delete the column with the longer hyperlinks, how is this possible since it is referencing the cell?
-------------
I think you either use VBA (which there is a code I found if you want) or you past it in MS Word and paste it back into Excel. There doesn't seem to be an easier way to do this.

Sir, how about: https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Copy-cell-values-not-formulas-12687b4d-c79f-4137-b0cc-947c229c55b9 ?

This wouldn't return a value where you can click on to go to the original hyperlink.

Holy shit this works!!  Thank you both for saving me 2 hours of converting each link!!

Dude, it worked for the first 2 links, I just tested and the rest do not work.  I don't know how that even happened.  Back to square one :(

Sure, no problem, hit /u/richardlee33 up with [["Solution verified"]](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/wiki/clippy#wiki_useage).

Did you verified that the pasted cell/value still have the hyperlink?

The cell did not retain the hyperlink - it only retained the value of the first cell in the column that the list was pasted into.  I jumped the gun too early and did not check the other cells.
-------------
I think the best option is to hide the web link column or have the web link column in a separate sheet and hide the sheet. 
-------------
Yes, this is what I will probably end up doing, good tip.

here, use this formula. change the cell reference to whatever (a1 in my example). copy paste the column as values, then do find/replace with "=" minus the quotes. that will make the text formulas calculate thus making your links work. it will retain the url without a cell reference. then you may just have to format them in the cell styles drop down in home tab if you want them to be blue.

    ="=hyperlink("&CHAR(34)&A1&CHAR(34)&","&CHAR(34)&"Click here for link"&CHAR(34)&")"
