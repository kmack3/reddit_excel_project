Stuck on slow Index/Match due to large range

Hi, I'm new to excel in terms of how long I've been working with it, however I'm fairly proficient with it. 

The workbook has 17 sheets, Jan-Dec, Totals, Individual Error-Rate, a reference sheet with all the names and initials, and 2 worksheets containing all the calculations.

The monthly sheets contain 93 possible entries for a person's initials (3 shifts per day of the month).

The main calculation sheet has the following formula.

    =IF(AND(JAN!E5=INDEX(Initials,MATCH(A2,Order,0)),NOT(JAN!C5="NEN"),NOT(JAN!C5=""),JAN!D6=""),1,0)

Where *Initials* and *Order* are named ranges. It provides me with a 1 if 2 criteria are met how I want them and a 0 if 3 criteria are met how I want them. The named ranges refer to my Reference worksheet that contains everyone I need, their initials, and a simply count range from 1 to 40. 

I have Macros that allow me to add and remove people from the Reference worksheet so the range can remain dynamic and so I can keep who I want at the top of the 1-40 range. 

The problem I run into is that when I do this for every single month of the year, the workbook gets extremely slow and adding or removing people to my Reference worksheet takes up to 2 minutes sometimes. 

So, my question is this, do you guys see any way I can optimize this process so that I don't need 2,000 lines of Index/Match functions which is what slows it all down.

The main problem is that I need that function to apply to 93 different possibilities per month along with up to 30 different people. Currently I don't see a way to shorten the process to allow the workbook to run more smoothly.

Thanks!

OK, without seeing your data, it's hard to come up with a better formula.

I will say, straight away, you don't need the `IF`, since all you're doing is returning a `1` (`TRUE`) or `0` (`FALSE`)

    =(JAN!E5=INDEX(Initials,MATCH(A2,Order,0)))*(JAN!C5<>"NEN")*(JAN!C5<>"")*(JAN!D6<>"")

Using this formula should roughly halve the number of calculations being performed, without all the `NOT`ing

I'm a bit confused by your comment 

> have Macros that allow me to add and remove people from the Reference worksheet so the range can remain dynamic and so I can keep who I want at the top of the 1-40 range

Is the range dynamic, or isn't it? Either the range is static (1:40), and you're doing something behind the scenes to move the names you're interested in to these rows, or it's dynamic.

At face value, unless your PC is underpowered, I wouldn't expect that these calculations should cause too much grief.

Do you have any `worksheet_change` events firing?

Are you using `INDIRECT` or `OFFSET` anywhere in the file? Or any whole-column array formulae?

>2,000 lines of Index/Match functions which is what slows it all down

I think you'll find that you're looking in the wrong place for the culprit

Make the named ranges dynamic so they're only sized to the actual data and sort them. That should speed things up. Also you can lock prior months with paste-special values if the historical data isn't going to be changed.
-------------
If you really believe the MATCH call is the cause of slow recalculation, and if the ranges named Initials and Order are in different places (though that seems unlikely), you could create a new table with first column the values from Order and second column the corresponding values from Initials. Then sort that table on its 1st column in ascending order, name it OITable, then replace the INDEX(Initials,MATCH(A2,Order,0)) term with VLOOKUP(A2,OITable,2).

Tangent: formulas of the form =IF(boolean_expression,1,0) could be replaced by formulas of the form =N(boolean_expression) or =--boolean_expression.

Thanks, I'll try to ditch the IF and NOTs in my formulas. 

You see, it's not just the Macro. While it definitely has something to do with the quality of the PC, I do believe I could definitely find a way to improve the workbook. The formula you reworded/recreated is about 1100 lines and they all reference a static range, A2:a41, on a separate worksheet. 

Anytime I insert or delete a row, it takes 90 seconds for it to complete when that happens. I believe it's because it has to cycle through all of those formulas to check the references.  
-------------
The formula I included in my post is the main problem. The named range it references is small, only 40 rows. The formula though needs to be applied to 93 does each worksheet and equates to about 1100 rows of references. 
-------------
I linked a copy of a version of the workbook above. It runs fine on my computer at home only taking a few seconds to add or remove rows whereas it takes 90 seconds at work. It's apparent now that the problem is the workbook is just too much for the PC to handle. Sorry I wasted your time. 
-------------
If it's not sensitive info, can you post a copy of the workbook to dropbox or similar?

1100 lines of `INDEX/MATCH` checking 40 rows is not a big burden.

Even when you add in 3 more tests (C5 twice and D6), it still doesn't seem to me that you should really see a big issue (even with all your not-ing!).

I'm still convinced that the actual recalculation burden is not in that formula

The actual file is on a secure network and I can't get it off of it without likely jail time so I recreated it. It's not entirely recreated because I didn't change the code beyond January since I won't be using this version. 

On my PC it adds rows in a few seconds. On the computer at work it takes up to 90 seconds. I guess that's proof of how the computer is the problem and not my workbook. Granted, the workbook at work is 4.5mb whereas the one I linked is only 2.7mb. 

Sorry I wasted your time.
