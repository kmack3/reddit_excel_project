Printing PDF with ExportAsFixedFormat but file size is twice as big as when manually creating PDF via Acrobat tab.

I'm taking an excel file and printing it in a macro with the following code:    
    ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Quality:=xlQualityMinimum, IgnorePrintAreas:=False,                
     Filename:="C:\Documents and Settings\test.pdf"    
  When I print this way the file size is nearly double the size then when I manually select the sheet, go to acrobat tab, and create pdf.  I've tried setting my print size as small as possible, reducing images, but can't get it to go any lower when creating the PDF with VBA.  Any ideas on how to minimize this any further?
