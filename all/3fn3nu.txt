Printing configuration, freeze panes and print titles options. Report printing question.

I have a report that utilizes Essbase to pull information.  The old report is really unfunctional for what we need.

I am recreating the report to display in a more favorable format.

My problem is I need to freeze panes so column A always shows.

I also need column A to show on a few pages, but NOT on all pages.

Finally, I need to either be able to scroll left/right and display the information different on page 1 (move column A to column H for example) but only freeze column H.

Alternatively I could put the information further columns down and add my labels in a column thete but then I need those pages (say page 4 and 5) not print column A and I need them to print FIRST so it would have to print in this order: 4,5,1,2,3.
