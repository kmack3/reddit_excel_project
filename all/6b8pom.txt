Freeze panes on same cell across multiple sheets?

Is there a VBA code that can help freeze panes at the same cell across multiple sheets at the same time?

This will freeze at the freeze point you set below. 

It returns you to the current window, and does not disturb the active cell for each worksheet.

    Sub freeze()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim wks As Worksheet
    Set wks = Application.ActiveSheet
    For Each ws In Worksheets
        ws.Select
        Set rng = ActiveCell
        Range("G5").Select '<== set Freeze point here
        ActiveWindow.FreezePanes = True
        'ActiveWindow.FreezePanes = False '<==uncomment to unfreeze pans
        rng.Select
    Next
    wks.Select
    End Sub
-------------
    Sub FreezePanes()
    'freeze rows 1-5 in all sheets of the active workbook
    Dim s As Worksheet
    For Each s In ActiveWorkbook.Sheets
    Application.Goto s.Range("A6")
    ActiveWindow.FreezePanes = True
    Next s
    End Sub
