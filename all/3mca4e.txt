Dealing with a large sequence of numbers

Right now I use a barcode scanner  to scan in numbers to a worksheet.
I need to track all these numbers and make sure none are missing. Id like to have the worksheet already have all the numbers before I scan and when I do scan the number that is already in the worksheet it will time stamp it for me, letting me know that it was in fact logged in and when. ive spent over an hour trying to get a time stamp macro already. anybody done something like this before?

Yo! 

this might work:

        Private Sub Worksheet_selectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
        
        On Error GoTo Handlr
        
        Dim MyWord As String
        
        MyWord = Target.Offset(-1, 0)
        
        If Range("A1:A5").Find(MyWord) > 0 Then
        Target.Offset(-1, 1).Value = Now
        Else
        End If
        
        Handlr:
        Exit Sub
        
        End Sub


put it in the VBA window for the sheet you're using.

So here's how this works (I don't know what your sheet looks like so I'm having to assume a few things).

you have a list of the barcode numbers in cells A1:A5.

You're scanning barcodes into, lets say column C. You scan one, hit enter to go to the next line, and if the barcode exists within A1:A5, the current date and time will appear in column D. Give it a go, and see what you think.

i played with it yestarday. i got an unexpected end sub code. im trying to figure it all out though, i have more free time today to fiddle with it.
-------------
I watched a video to make sure I was putting it in right. got it in ran the macro. scanned a code and it didn't respond the way anticipated. it gave a compile error, expected end sub.
im very new to excel to. Im going to continue trying other methods form different sources to insert the code/macro.

so I got it to work. unfortunately not with your macro, and not to the level I want. I thought learning vba would help a lot so I have been. looking at your code it is quite clever, yet simple which we strive for at times.
-------------
In the VBA window I inserted a new module, copy and pasted your code in the window in the VBA, from there I pressed run, then exited to my worksheet via file/exit to excel worksheet. With my numbers in A1:A5 and only those cells for test purposes. I ran the macro then scanned the barcodes that went with the numbers in A1:A5 all it did was continue placing my numbers in A6 down. FYI the numbers I scanned continued in the cell that was selected. Did I do anything wrong inputting the macro?
