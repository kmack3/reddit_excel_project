Inserting comments causing Excel to freeze

Windows 7. MS-Office 365 version 15.0.4745.1002

One certain workbook freezes when I attempt to add a comment sometimes. Nothing unusual about the file except that it has more comments than other workbooks. When it happens, I can't click x in upper right corner, I have to end the process from Task Manager. When this happens I sometimes have programs like QuickBooks open that continue to run smoothly.

It has made me have to reenter work I had just done. Not sure what else to add. PC has 3 gigs of ram and runs fine otherwise.
