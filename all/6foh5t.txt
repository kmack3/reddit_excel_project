Tips on filtering large set of data.

I have a large file which is full of values at different time stamps, I would like to filter the data so that I am able to take the value right before a reading of 0. Basically would like to extract the numbers preceding a zero. Is there anyway to do this in excel or would I have to go write some code to do this. Appreciate the help!


-------------
Add an autofilter, click the filter arrow on your column with the values, go to "Number Filters", "Less than" and type 0. [This](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/cffab584-2e0f-4817-9eb8-2277c25ed311.jpg) might help a bit.

Add a helper column with extracts that value, filter on helper column.

`=LEFT(A2,FIND(0,A2)-1)`
