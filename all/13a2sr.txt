I would like to know how to combine many excell spreadsheets containing only one row into one large spreadsheet containing all the rows. More info inside. 

I have included this screen shot of the billing form I work with:

I would like to know what is the best way to combine around 200 of these into one spreadsheet to gather the totals. I am using excel 14.0.0 in office 2011 for mac. 

Thanks in advance!

I need a little info to make this right because I'm not a magician.

Do all the workbooks come with 3 sheets? 

Are all the workbooks just importing one line at row 14?

If both of those = yes, then copy and paste this in a module and run the subroutine...locate your folder they're stored in on prompt.

     Declare Function SHGetPathFromIDList Lib "shell32.dll" _
    Alias "SHGetPathFromIDListA" (ByVal pidl As Long, ByVal _
    pszpath As String) As Long

    Alias "SHBrowseForFolderA" (lpBrowseInfo As BrowseInfo) _

    On Error Resume Next
    Dim bInfo As BrowseInfo

    Dim r As Long, x As Long, pos As Integer
     
     'Root folder = Desktop
    bInfo.pIDLRoot = 0&
     
     'Title in the dialog
    If IsMissing(msg) Then
        bInfo.lpszTitle = "Please select the folder of the excel files to copy."
    Else
        bInfo.lpszTitle = msg
    End If
     
     'Type of directory to return
    bInfo.ulFlags = &H1
     
     'Display the dialog
    x = SHBrowseForFolder(bInfo)
     
     'Parse the result
    path = Space$(512)
    r = SHGetPathFromIDList(ByVal x, ByVal path)
    If r Then
        pos = InStr(path, Chr$(0))
        GetDirectory = Left(path, pos - 1)
    Else
        GetDirectory = ""

I didn't write this. I just adjusted it to what I perceived your needs as. I can adjust it further it if does not work, just let me know what exactly happens. I highly recommend running it by pressing F8 repeatedly so you can see exactly what it's doing and where/if it fails.

Also note: Name your workbook report as something that isn't any of the names of your imports.

Also note: If there's only one worksheet per book, just delete these lines:

            n = n - 1
            Application.Goto (ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1).Range("A1").Offset(n, 0))
            ActiveCell.EntireRow.Select
            Selection.Delete
            n = n - 1
            Application.Goto (ThisWorkbook.Sheets(1).Range("A1").Offset(n, 0))
            ActiveCell.EntireRow.Select
            Selection.Delete

Are they in different sheets or different workbooks?
-------------
the only way I know how is this http://www.powerpivotpro.com/2012/09/combine-multiple-worksheetsworkbooks-into-a-single-powerpivot-table/

But it'll still require playing around with your sheets unfortunately.  Otherwise you could learn vba and have it find the rows for you and add them.  Each have their own ups and downs.

An excellent macro for free download, I use it frequently:

RDBMerge excel files macro

I think you can find it at [http://www.rondebruin.nl/merge.htm](http://www.rondebruin.nl/merge.htm)

Are they across multiple tabs in the same workbook? or are they in separate workbooks?

Need to know if they are all laid out exactly the same or if they are on differing lines as well...
-------------
Thanks for your thoughtful reply!! Iv saved this to try next time. I just did this one all by hand with copy/paste 
-------------
different sheets. I am actually not sure what a workbook looks like. I have quite a few different files all named differently that all look approximately like that one I included a picture of. 
-------------
I guess I was hoping for an easy solution. It doesn't look like there is one. I suppose I better start copy/pasting!
-------------
I admire your patience! 

Definitely give this a shot next time and follow up on this if you need a hand. 
-------------
So they are 200 different excel files? Or are they 1 excel file with 200 little tabs down at the bottom? 

If they are files, are they named in any sort of order or are they all random names?
-------------
Yeh I'm sorry to say it but I think you're right.

That's the trouble with data that's arranged in a 'visual' way.
-------------
They are 200 excel files with no order to their names. 
-------------
Thanks anyway!

you're welcome
