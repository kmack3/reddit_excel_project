freeze

Is is possible to freeze half of (or one quadrant of) a worksheet?

I'd like the left half of the worksheet (or the upper left quadrant) to remain fixed while the right half scrolls normally.

Freeze panes and splits don't quite do what I want.

I can do the split which allows independent *horizontal* scrolling on the right side, but it won't scroll vertically independent of the left side.

I can do the freeze panes to lock the upper left quadrant how I want, but then the upper right quadrant is also locked for vertical scrolling which means only the lower right quadrant scrolls how I want it.


-------------
Use View - New Window, and then View - Arrange All - Vertical. Resize/adjust panes as needed to each view the section you want. Each window will have it's own view settings.

I don't think there is a solution, that's not the way panes work.  Only work-arounds I can think of:
-Multiple windows of the same worksheet (per /u/CFAman 's suggestion
-Putting your legend above your data instead of to the right (which would likely require laying it out horizontally )
-Perhaps there's a convoluted solution using VBA to re-calculate the cell contents upon moving the cursor selection, but it would be messy and probably ground performance to a halt with constant screen updates.

If there were an event for scrolling rather than SelectionChange, you could use a picture link to keep the same apparent region on the left as you scrolled the right. But there isn't.

Using a second window and some XLM cleverness may be the only way to approximate this.

Create a new Word document and change the orientation to landscape. Insert a table with two cells side by side. Copy/paste special  your freezed area from excel into the left cell and paste link the free moving part of the spreadsheet into the right cell. Adjust margins to suit. When you click in an Excel cell the Word ribbon changes to an Excel ribbon letting you work in Excel. It's a bit messy - depends how important you want this thing.

New Windows from Excel 2013 on (with the loss of MDI) each have their own ribbon. Granted it's possible to use some XLM cleverness.

    With Application
      .ExecuteExcel4Macro "SHOW.TOOLBAR(""Ribbon"",FALSE)"
      .DisplayFormulaBar = False
      .DisplayScrollBars = False
      .DisplayStatusBar = False
    End With

That makes the new windows look more like a pane, but good luck getting it to remain above all other Excel windows. Tiling many Excel windows isn't pleasant these days.

___ADDENDUM:___ Excel applies the first statement above by window, but the others for the application as a whole. If you want to see the formula bar, scroll bars and status bar in the scrollable portion, they'd also be visible in other windows. You'd have to use a separate Excel application instance to load the workbook read-only, then manipulate the second instance via Automation. In short, what the OP wants to do is now something Excel does rather poorly. Perhaps this is a job for LibreOffice.

I use multiple windows all the time. But that's not want I want in this case.

Sounds like this isn't really an option. Thanks for the input.

Wow. No I don't need it that badly. Thanks for the suggestion though.
