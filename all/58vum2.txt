2 questions : freeze reference content in a cell + select all cells from selected to botom of the column

Hello,

I have 2 things that I would need to learn to do with Excel in order to make a kickass spreadsheet tool for work.

Here is it :

1) "Freeze" the content reference of a cell even is this reference is cut/paste.
I'll only be able to explain with an example :

In A1 I have "abc".
In B1 I have "abc".
In A2 I have "def".
In B2 I have "ghi".

In C1 I put this formula =IF(A1=B1,"YES","NO") and extend this formula vertically on the column (so automaticly on C2 i will have =IF(A2=B2,"YES","NO").

So, In my actual setup in C1 I will have "YES" and in C2 I will have "NO".
So far no problem.

The thing is, now I go on A1 and press ctrl X, then ctrl V on A2, then I go in B1, press ctrl X, then ctrl V in B2.
And now in C1 i'll have =IF(A2=B2,"YES","NO") and in C2 a broken formula looking for non existing references.

Me, I want that after my 2 CTRL X and CTRL V, in the case C1 and C2 the formula do not change, it's sill respectively =IF(A1=B1,"YES","NO") and =IF(A2=B2,"YES","NO"), the fact that I cut did not move the references into the forumulas.
So, after the cut/paste, in C1 I would like to have "YES" and in C2 "YES" (since A1=B1, the two being empty, and A2=B2 now that there is "abc" in both cells).

The formulas is C1 and all the cells below after I extend C1 in the column are frozen and do not edit because of my cut/paste.

2) Select all cells in a column from the selected cell to the bottom of the column.
This one is easier to explain.

What I would need :
I select A10.
I do a magic manipulation, and my selection is now A10 to A10.000 (or any high number being very far in the bottom of the column).
I deal with huge data tables and often need to modify the vertical position of the datas in the column, but not all the datas, datas starting from a certain one. Example : it's a really a huge loss of time to everytime have to select A10, then scroll back to A500, press shft and press A500 before my cut/paste to put those datas to A13 to A513.

Thank you very much for your help

1) Two solutions. One is to stop cutting and pasting, and use copy and paste instead, then delete A1 and B1 if you want. The other solution is to use a function like OFFSET or INDIRECT. `=IF(OFFSET(C1,0,-2)=OFFSET(C1,0,-1),"YES","NO")` or `=IF(INDIRECT("A"&ROW(C1))=INDIRECT("B"&ROW(C1)),"YES","NO")`, e.g. Note both of those are now relative to *C*1, not A1 or B1. The junk with `&ROW(C1)` is there to keep the formula 'dynamic' as you drag it down.

2) Ctrl+Shift+Down. Also, use Ctrl+Enter to enter a dynamic formula into multiple cells. Like if you have data in A1:A1000, select B1, Ctrl+Shift+Down, formula bar type in `=A1` and Ctrl+Enter, and B1=A1, B2=A2.. BN=AN.
