Vlookup on large list to find and replace cell information

I am trying to write a script that is basically a vlookup. 

I have a document which has hundreds of abbreviations and I want the script to replace the abbreviations with the full text. The list of abbreviations and full text is 71,000 rows (6mb). 

I have dozens of these documents that I want to replace the abbreviations and I don't want to copy and paste all the 71,000 rows in to the document as it will increase the file size. 

I was thinking about inputting all the abbreviations and full text into my script on VBA and use a loop to sift through it, but I worry this will cause the file size to increase after saving. I also don't want to have to open another excel document with all the abbreviations and full text definitions. 

I am wondering if there is another way I can open a document that has all the abbreviations, run my macro to replace the abbreviations with the full text and then when I save the document, it does not drastically change in size.

As I explain this, I wonder if the best course of action is to include the abbreviations and full text into the script itself...

Not exactly following -- what is tripling your file size? VBA code occupies very little memory.

When I add the 71,000 rows of text to the code, or if I add a sheet with the 71,000 rows, my file goes from 2mb to 6mb. Although that is still a small size relatively, I have thousands of these files and scale its a problem.

I think we need more explanation of what your macro is doing. There is no way you need 71000 rows of text in the code, you just need to create a loop that runs 71000 times.

Hopefully the description is more clear.

Do you have 71000 unique abbreviations??

Even several hundred lines of code will only add a few kb to your file size

yes

In response to your latest revision, yes, you can have the macro open a workbook that has all the abbreviations and full text stored, then use that to make the replacements. That would save you some file size I suppose. 

You can/should just have a single file with VBA in it. The file can loop through all your other workbooks. There's no reason to add the same code to thousands of files. So perhaps the best option for you here is to have a single file with all the abbreviations and the VBA code, then have it loop through all your files and make the changes.

I just saved a blank XLSX workbook. 8kb.

I then added 64,000 lines of VBA code with 100 characters each and saved as XLSM.

Save size is now 456kb. Less than 0.5MB added. Just FYI  


EDIT: I also just made a workbook that is a list of 100,000 6-character abbreviations and 75-character full text strings. File size is ~300kb.
