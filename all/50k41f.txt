Excel crashes everytime!

Every time I open an excel file, it will open up just fine and I am able to navigate and edit just fine. But whenever I right click anywhere, it crashes and will reopen the program and I will have to select the file from the "recover" pane.

This sounds like something you'd be better off looking into MS tech support with tbh.

Nonetheless, I'll have a crack.. Is there anything unusual about your setup or the way you installed Excel? Was it a fresh install or over the top of an old version of Office?

it might be that file. try saving that file under another name. if you havent done this first, update your office application. File >>Account >>Update Options > Update Now

Nothing unusual. It was a fresh install.
