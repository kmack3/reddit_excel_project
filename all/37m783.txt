How do I freeze columns A-D AND rows 1-4?

I've been collaborating with 3 other people on Google Sheets but am paranoid about Google snooping. Going to try to switch to everyone using Dropbox and editing in Excel. For this particular sheet I want to freeze the first 4 rows and the first 4 columns. This was easy to do in Sheets but I am having trouble in Excel.

I'm using Excel 2011 for Mac. I select row 5 and go to Window>Freeze Panes. This freezes the first 4 rows. When I try to do the same for the columns the option is to unfreeze. So, I tried to select the first 4 rows and then press command key and select the 4 columns and freeze panes it doesn't work.

Help.
