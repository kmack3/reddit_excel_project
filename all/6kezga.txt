I was trying to use LARGE formula, but it didn't work.

Are you using the english version of excel, with comma separators for functions?

Try tro write =LAR in a cell. Does it autocomplete to LARGE automatically?

I am not at a computer to double check this, but I think you may need to enter this one as an array formula by hitting crtl + shift + enter instead of just enter.

OMG. I just realized. I don't know what language version I am using, but it seems that it uses ; for separators. Thanks!

I'm pretty sure this is incorrect, it is a matrix formula.

Yes, you are correct. I was wrong.
