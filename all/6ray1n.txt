Best way to compare 2 big excel files

I am faced with comparing 2 big excel files (each one is about 30mb) - each file contains of 15 sheets . The thing is I cannot use Compare Spreadsheets from Windows since we do not own licence. 

How would you guys go on about comparing these two? I've tried using winmerge but it takes too long (1,5h and still processing data)


-------------
That big, that many sheets? How many rows of data?

Python may be the answer here.

-------------
Some sheets have about 60k and 100k rows, and like 3 or 5 sheets have about 20 rows
