Win 10 + Excel: Removing filters takes forever...

When Win 10 was first released, I installed it... Only to find that Excel was now having big issues with unfiltering columns in medium to large spreadsheets (7,000+ lines). In Win 8.1, removing the filter was almost instantaneous; now, however, Excel would take several minutes (or longer) to calculate and remove the filter (or not respond at all).

I switched back to Windows 8.1, which fixed the problem.

Foolishly, I switched back to Windows 10 a few days ago. The problem came back. It often takes ages to unfilter in largish spreadsheets, which is a major problem when 90% of my job involves Excel.

Has anyone else encountered this problem? Any solutions? As far as I can tell from various forums, Microsoft hasn't acknowledged the issue.

(I've encountered the issue in Excel 2013 and 2016). Tech specs: Acer Aspire laptop (new 2015, Pentium 2.16GHz, 8 GB ram)

I've not had the problem myself and don't have a solution to offer. As far as I know there's no way to officially submit bug reports, and while I'm not sure whether this strictly counts as a bug it certainly sounds buggy.

You might be able to let the Excel team know about the problem through their suggestions website, excel.uservoice.com.
