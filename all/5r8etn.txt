Very slow at pasting values if there is a certain condition

Hi!  
I've found this strange behavior.  

**Case Scenario**:  
XLSM/XLSX file with two sheets.  
`Sheet1` has a ListObject/Table **where 3 columns have formulas** referencing the sheet itself.  
`Sheet2` has another ListObject/Table **without formulas**.  

**Problem**:  
when pasting a fairly medium sized CSV in it (~21k rows) in **Sheet2** Excel takes too much time to paste the data.  
  
**After deleting the 3 formula columns in Sheet1 the paste action on Sheet2 take less than 1 second**.  
  
The **formula columns in Sheet1 don't reference Sheet2 and Sheet2 doesn't reference Sheet1**
  
I noticed this while scripting a procedure to update some data, without the formulas it takes 00:00:07 second to update 5 sheets with roughly 750.000+ cells in total. With the formulas it takes one minute and a half (00:01:33).  
I already tried to:  
`Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual`  
`Application.EnableEvents = False`  
`Application.ScreenUpdate = False`
  
The only way I'm able to really speed it up, and having it to do the operation in 7 seconds, is to delete the formulas --> update the needed data (paste the data from the CSVs) --> reinsert the formulas.  
  
Is there a better fix for this?  
I've already implemented my solution with an helper sheet that store all the formulas needed in a matrix, but if there is a oneliner :) I'd like it.

Do you need to have these in the same workbook? (only saying this cause of "formula columns in Sheet1 don't reference Sheet2 and Sheet2 doesn't reference Sheet1").

Unfortunately yes.  
Fun fact: updating the sheet that has the column formulas works flawlessly.

Awww man, there goes my lead suggestion! 

We could always automate you taking the formulas out and plopping them back in (as you see improved speeds in this case). Is that too much of a hassle for this?

Hope it's working out!

Already done this :) (pssst it's written on the bottom of the post), and it's working.

Ahhhh I was thinking a little VBA script to just delete formulas, do the csv stuff, and repopulate formulas. If it is working at least we are operational!
