After saving and closing a big workbook, my formatting is completely gone on all sheets.

Hello,

I wonder if there is some kind of button that turns the formatting off, but I think my file got corrupted. Is there any way that I could recover my file, or show the color/formatting again? is there an autosave function that might have saved me?

thanks in advance.


-------------
File>Options>Save will give you the status of your autorecovery settings and folder location.

As well, you can try Windows version history: 

Right click the file, Previous Versions (if it is enabled on your machine)
-------------
Check the file type.  I've saved things as csv which loses all formatting when you close it.

I have a previous version from 5 hours ago, but that one is also without formatting. when I never saw the file without the formatting today. the version from yesterday still has the formatting, but is missing the work I did today.

.xlsx

Recognizing that I don't know what sort of formatting you applied, you could copy the worksheet for your Good data into your Formatted workbook. Then copy/paste special>formats
-------------
this sounds like a solution that could work. but I'm left with questions still. how could it disappear from all sheets at once after saving. 

thanks so far

Depends on the formatting and the File format. If you used formats exclusive to 2013, for example, but saved it in a file format such as 97-2003 it won't store that information.

I have been working in 2007 and saving in the exact same way every time. ->   .xlsx

That's all I've got. Any other users accessing this Workbook?
-------------
nope! :/

Stumped.
