Adding a 'Current Value' in a freeze row for a continuous list

I have a document where there will be a continuous set of entries. You set a starting value for each class which has its own column. For example, Class A would be C5:C and Class B would be D5:D.

Each row then has you enter the change you want to one of the classes. A positive change on one class can also affect another (positively or negatively).

I hope that makes some sense... Either way, feel free to take a look at mess around with the file found **>[>HERE<](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GcLxhGTbih4AEG1uuPV_GjWpd4gBFAro95SwNh6Yzx8/edit?usp=sharing)<**

I'm really drawing a blank right now and I don't think it should be this hard... The only way I see to do it is by adding a really lengthy COUNTIF type of thing... and I'm not quite sure what it would look like. But it should make more sense once you see it.

##What I Need:
A formula for the yellow boxes to show the most recent value for that class. At time of posting, the yellow boxes should read:

* C2 = 27.5

* D2 = 2.5

* E2 = 2.5

* F2 = 55


-------------
How about this in c2? =AVERAGEIF($A5:$A,C1,C5:C) then, you can drag right and it will update the others.
-------------
That seems to work (for Class A) but I have no idea how it works.

It's checking the list of entries between A5:A to find if the value matches C1 (in this case, "A", and then takes the average of C5:C (changes in A)? How does it account for when Class A sees a reduction in value due to Class C gaining value?

Also: The formula does not work at all when used in the other cells. B is reading as 20 though it should be 2.5. C as 5 when it should be 2.5. D as 51.25 when it should be 55.
-------------
Oh.... Just realized I misread that. I think a combination of max and if, and a counter column would help. Let me look again.
-------------
The thing I'm having trouble accounting for is the positive/negative relationships between A B C and D

Something sort of like this:

|| A | B | C | D |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| A |1|0.5|-1|0|
| B |0|1|0.5|-1|
| C |-1|0|1|0.5|
| D |0.5|-1|0|1|

That's what I'm having trouble accounting for. Otherwise I could just use something along the lines of the Starting Value and the sum of the changes.

What I think I'll end up having to do is creating a helper table in the background that prints the change for each class and then use a sum of that against the starting value.
-------------
Feel weird replying to myself but uh..

Yeah, the helper table is really the simplest solution. I don't know how to do what this helper table does in a simple formula. I just either don't know the function for it or it does not exist.
