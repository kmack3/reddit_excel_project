Trying to freeze a row and column at the same time

My boss passed me an excel sheat that had the first 2 rows and the first 2 columns frozen at the same time. How do i do that?


-------------
Select the first cell that you still want moveable. From your description, this would be cell C3. Then hit the freeze cells option (first option in the freeze panel under the View tab).
-------------
The feature is called Freeze Panes, on the View ribbon.

You can either freeze the first row, the first column, or a variable number of columns above and to the left of the active cell.

SOLUTION VERIFIED!
