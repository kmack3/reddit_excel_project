Me want every other row to be grey, for readability. How? Me use control and highlight manually usually. Take long time.

Is making your data into a table an option? (Ctrl+T).

Otherwise, highlight two rows, Format Painter the rest?
-------------
Colour first row. Highlight this row and the one below it. Copy. Then shift and scroll down to the bottom of page/where you want it to stop. 
Paste special formatting.
-------------
Select all, conditional format them such that every second one is grey by having conditional formatting according to this:


=MOD(ROW(),2)


Set your formatting to what you wish for every second row.
-------------
Highlight one row and make it grey.  Then select that row and the next row.  Then go to the bottom right of the selection until you see the dark black cross-hair, when you do click and drag the selection through your data.

I agree.  Table would be my first choice.

Another option is conditional formatting.  Use a formula such as:  

    =MOD(ROW(), 2)=0  

To put some colors on even numbered rows.  or make it "=1" for odd numbered rows.

I don't understand what tables are meant for? Directories of customer accounts? A big long calendar?

Thanks, that will be handy.

This is the hard way. Just use Tables. You get other table magic for free, too.

Firstly Awesome answer and for normal stuff it works exceptionally. But if you filter then you need "=MOD(SUBTOTAL(3,$A$1:$A1),2)=0" to keep it every other row.

[This should probably explain it better](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/919194). You are merely 'formatting as a table' so that your data is colored all neatly.
-------------
A table is simply a formatted portion of the spreadsheet. Use the table formats on the Home tab and experiment. Many of them are preformatted with alternating light and dark rows.

[Here's an article from Microsoft.](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/apply-shading-to-alternate-rows-in-a-worksheet-HA010342176.aspx)

Tables are often slower with huge datasets

That's nice to know, thanks.
