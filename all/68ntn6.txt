Is there a way to create an excel "search engine" for a large spreadsheet with multiple variables to extract statistics without having to create specific COUNTIFS formula each time?

I have a spreadsheet with a large amount of data: 14,000 rows and 15 columns (birthday, age at arrival, current age, nationality, date of arrival, gender, case size, language etc). 

Currently, if I want to find a certain stat, I use COUNTIFS to formulate an answer. This is time consuming and annoying when searching for more than one thing. 

Is there a way to create a sheet within my spreadsheet that can me manipulated to act like a search engine? I realize that I could filter for specific results but I'm trying to avoid that. 

Any help would be much appreciated!

[PivotTables](http://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/pivot-tables.html) sound like the solution you're looking for.

Pivot table that you can just refresh as needed.

Hey Dude, saw your follow up questions - 

Just click anywhere in your massive data table, hit insert, pivot table. 

Clicking through will create the pivot in a new tab, and you can then build the pivot by defining what you want to see in your rows/columns/filters etc. You can then pretty easily sort on the criteria you are looking for.

From what you've stated though, I'm not exactly sure this is what you want. What exactly is the criteria you are attempting to search by?

What do you want to be able to do and then see? If you can provide a specific example, it may be easier to provide a solution. Based on your picture, it seems like you want to be able to type specific criteria somewhere and get a list detailing the count of all of those met conditions for each of your columns. I may be wrong though.

If you don't want to go the pivot route (its the best way, but has a learning curve) you can continue with your Countifs, you just need to use variables instead of absolutes. 

For example: in Col A, define the variables you want to be able to search with by name. In Col B, enter the variable values. 

Now in Col C, write the same if statements you would use to find the info by hand, but instead of using specific values, use cell references to the Variables. 

Now when ever you change the variables in Col b, the formulas will update with the results given the new information.

You could potentially try adding slicers for all the different variables you have. That would allow filtering for multiple different variables.

Excuse my pivot table ignorance, where would I start with that? I would want it to have something like this https://ibb.co/e2THD5 where you could just enter in what you needed and it would spit a number out to the side. Something that would also be able to operate when you are looking for let's say two variables.

Thanks for the reply, looking at the comments I've been playing around with pivot tables. 

That being said, ideally, using that picture as context, I would be able to set up something where you could plug in a nationality, gender, age and with all the other variables blank, it could still produce a count. 

I've tried before, using countifs but it wouldn't work when having blank variables . If I was searching for 3 things and didn't fill it the other spots, it returned 0 or #VALUE.

assuming there are no blank cells in any row (i.e. row populated but missing arrival date) lets say you wanted to know the breakout of languages spoken of the patients in your table. you'd create a pivot table then drag language to the row labels and any other variable that was populated in every row to values. So say, sex is populated in each row you would drag language to row labels and sex to values.

Go look at these

So you're looking for an "answer" of one number that is the count of all entries meeting the criteria you enter?

IE. you enter an age, nationality, and gender and you receive a single number telling you how many entries are of that age, nationality, and gender?

Thanks!

Yes, I would like to get one number (answer) for any certain number of variable inputs.

Slicers on a pivot table are what you need.

Okay, I *think* I can do that

Messing with some stuff now, I'll get back to you shortly

Alright got it!

To test it, I created [this](http://imgur.com/a/5MLpE) table based on the information you provided. Cells A2:H100 are populated with randomly generated letters to symbolize whatever data would be input there. 

To the right, I copied the cell headers into cells J1:Q1, and used cells J2:Q2 as the "Search Engine" entry section. Below that, I created the output cell "Count" in cell J4. This is shown [here.](http://imgur.com/a/3U2xW)

The formula entered in cell K5, calculating the "answer" and count of all conditions meeting those entered in the "Search Engine" section is as follows:

    =IF(J2:Q2="",0,SUMPRODUCT((IF(J2="",1,$A$2:$A$100=J2))*(IF(K2="",1,$B$2:$B$100=K2))*(IF(L2="",1,$C$2:$C$100=L2))*(IF(M2="",1,$D$2:$D$100=M2))*(IF(N2="",1,$E$2:$E$100=N2))*(IF(O2="",1,$F$2:$F$100=O2))*(IF(P2="",1,$G$2:$G$100=P2))*(IF(Q2="",1,$H$2:$H$100=Q2))))

This is also shown [here.](http://imgur.com/a/hNmgS)

This must be entered with as an array formula with CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER, as opposed to just enter. (Although I'm not exactly sure why currently, as SUMPRODUCT is not supposed to require that entry format).

There is an easier way to do this to rapidly create the formula, but I wanted to make it as straightforward as possible so that it would be easier for you to replicate and apply to your scenario. 

It will be very important that all of your number formatting aligns between the "Search Engine" and the corresponding data. Its easy in this application, since I used all letters, but you'll need to make sure, for example, that the way you enter the dates in the "Search Engine" is the same formatting as the way the dates are formatted in the data table. 

The end result looks something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/7qVT9) where I have searched for the count of instances with a Birthday of A, Age of Arrival of B, Date of Arrival of C and Case Size of D. There was 1 instance of this which I confirmed in the table!

Hope this is what you were looking for!

I think this may be what I'm looking for, which would be amazing. Let me try it out and get back to you. Thanks!
