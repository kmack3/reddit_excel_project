Big VBA project, have a plan but need help getting started.

Already posted this in r/VBA but would like input from this sub aswell.

Hi guys here is my enquiry hope you can help!

So I made a form that we send to customers that allows them to order stuff and click a button to trigger a macro to send it to our sales email.

My new project I want to work on is a way to collect data from all these files we receive so I could make a spreadsheet that calculates each individual products growth rate (based on order amounts)and other stuff.

My plan to do this would be to make subfolders named after the months(they go into the folder based on month we receive the order), to save these orders to in excel format.

Then I would have a macro that would loop through each file in these month folders and post the quantity these products were ordered into one of 12 sheets(also named after months) depending on from what folder they came from.

My question is how do I get it to find the quantity of the item I want, I'm guessing VBA Vlookup but on that note how would I get it to automatically add the product quantities of each sheet together and if not could I have them paste into a line of cells so that I could simply sum() them, naturally I would do this for every product?

Doing my own research all these things seem possible individually like looping through folder of excel docs and cut/pasting but how do I combine all of this together to where it works with no or minimal issues.

Here's some code for reading specific cell data from closed documents (So you don't have to open them to view their data every single time)

    Public Function PeekFileCellString(ByVal FilePath As String, ByVal FileName As String, ByVal WorksheetName As String, ByVal CellRow As Long, ByVal CellCol As Long) As String
        PeekFileCellString = CStr(ExecuteExcel4Macro("'" & FilePath & "\" & "[" & FileName & "]" & WorksheetName & "'!" & Cells(CellRow, CellCol).Address(1, 1, xlR1C1)))
    End Function

And here's some code that lets you loop through files within a specified folder:

    Dim FileName As Object
    Dim FSO:		Set FSO = CreateObject("scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Dim Folder:		Set Folder = FSO.GetFolder("TargetFolderPath")

    For Each FileName In Folder.Files
		'Do stuff here
    Next

Huh, that's a new one to me. Neat trick! I didn't know you could read from an Excel file without opening it.
