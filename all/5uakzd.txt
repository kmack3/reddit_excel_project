Excel VBA Script Crashes When Refreshing Power Queries Using Task Scheduler

I have an xlsm file with a macro that on open, it will launch a Master xlsx of my choice, refresh all the Power Queries (20+ queries), save the Master file and quit excel.  The macro file is 20k and the master file is 2MB.

If I open the xlsm manually, the queries all refresh as normal in under 30 seconds.  However if I use task scheduler or any windows automation software to open that xlsm, excel goes non responsive and i have to force quit.  

Anyone experience anything like this before?  This same code works on all other PQ files I refresh and those range form 10MB-20MB however have far less queries to refresh.  

Here is the VBA code I'm using.  


    Option Explicit
    
    Public Function GetPath() As String
        Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogOpen).Show
            If Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogOpen).SelectedItems.Count > 0 Then
            GetPath = Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogOpen).SelectedItems(1)
        End If
    End Function
    
    Public Sub Load_DLY_Path()
        Range("Path_DLY").Value = GetPath()
    End Sub
    
    
    Public Sub Main()
        Dim strDailyscrape_Path As String
        Dim wbDailyscrape As Workbook
        Dim DebugMode As Boolean
        strDailyscrape_Path = Range("Path_DLY").Value
        DebugMode = Range("DebugMode").Value
        
        
        Set wbDailyscrape = Workbooks.Open(strDailyscrape_Path)
        
        wbDailyscrape.RefreshAll
        Application.CalculateUntilAsyncQueriesDone
    
        
        If DebugMode Then MsgBox ("Daily Scrape updated successfully!")
        
     wbDailyscrape.Save
        
        
        Application.DisplayAlerts = False
        wbDailyscrape.Close (True)
        Application.DisplayAlerts = True
        If DebugMode Then MsgBox ("Done!")
        Application.Quit
    End Sub
    



-------------
I've seen PQ + VBA excel sheets fail when opened on desktops where no PQ was installed. Not tried this though.

Have you tried a minimal excel which did next to nothing - VBA to set a cell to a value and maybe run a trivial PQ?
