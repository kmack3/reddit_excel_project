Need sample data to sandbox Big(ish) Data learning. And pivot tables, vlookup & multivariate regression tips & faqs

Hi, all. I’m doing web analytics coursework and am venturing into deeper waters. Exporting datasets into Excel then running statistical analysis on them. Techniques like regressions, vlookups and pivots. I could just generate some garbage numbers but it’d be nice to have something that has actual patterns to it so I can see what I’m doing.

Unfortunately, I’m going out on my own so I can’t ask the Prof (tho I think he’ll be pleased once I’m sorta-mastered it). I don’t need gigs of data but perhaps 20pp worth? Even better if someone has a dataset for which the answers exist so I can check my work.

Repeat: don’t need a Gig of data and too-random numbers or too-orderly numbers aren’t needed. Tho, thanks.

**Most Ideal Dataset: Web Analytics Data, labelled, of a decent heft (20-100pp worth?)** Perhaps with “answers” to various functions to check my work with.

More generally, are there any vids, blogs, FAQs that are worth mentioning? I’ve seen some YouTube vids that seem decent. Some blogs help for each function. But I can’t seem to find a single source that mimics Big(ish) Data techniques for intellectually curious people. Particularly of the sort that something like Omniture or Google Analytics would generate.

Thanks so much!
