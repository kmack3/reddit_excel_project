A different kind of Excel question - Excel 2016 crashes on making any formatting changes to any cell in any sheet in any book.

Hi all. I am running office 365/2016 - I can open any Excel file, make a new file, edit it, or do anything really..but once I hit bold, italic, underline, or anything of this nature, Excel locks up and will crash. 

So far I've:

* Restarted my device

* Ran office "Quick Repair"

* Ran office "online repair"

* Completely uninstalled office and reinstalled it

None of those do anything and I'm at a loss. I'm trying a different version now, like Insider Slow just to see. Anyone seen something like this before?

[Same problem here](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-mso_winother/excel-2013-crashes-when-formatting-a-cell/2a6435c5-e932-4869-afe7-2fbeacf900fd) for 2013, use same troubleshoot method...

Make user you have all the latest updates installed also.

Reinstall seemed to fix it. It still locked up for a moment but then figured itself out and bolded the cell. After that it was fine.

Please change the flair to solved
