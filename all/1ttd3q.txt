Local Excel files slow to load when connected to VPN

Good morning/afternoon/evening.

So here's the run down: I work at a helpdesk and my brain is scrambled by this single issue I see once in a great while. Currently, I have a user who works from home and uses a VPN for file access and network validation. When he is connected to the VPN, opening Excel files on his computer (not the network drive) can take anywhere from 2-5 minutes. If he disconnects from the VPN, but still maintains his residential internet connection, Excel files open almost instantly.

Windows 7 Ent. 64bit, Office 2010 Pro Plus, IE 9 (if it matters), i believe i5 w/ 6gb ram.

This is only Excel. Word or other documents do not have this issue. All Excel documents, despite the version or how many calculations are in the document, exhibit this problem.

So far, I have tried disabling/enabling IE's auto configure networks setting, add/remove/MS Fixits File Validation update, repaired office, uninstalled/reinstalled office, disconnected the one mapped network drive, disabled/enabled file sharing settings under network and sharing, removed his printers (cause I was desperate and that sounded logical at this point) and other steps over the past few months I just can't recall.

Again, this is only when connected to the VPN and even when files are opened locally on his machine. Unfortunately, I cannot walk him through reformatting the machine. I wish it were an option, but it is not.

Plum frazzled. At this point, there is a bounty for the successful fix. I won't even get started on the Acrobat/Office issues... but maybe. 

<b>Edit:</b> Thank you, /u/innsyflares !!! By using ProcMon I found a folder that was mapped to a server that no longer exists! Office was trying to communicate (validation?) via this pathway despite a newer mapping in place, probably due to the user retrieving the files from this source in the past. I can finally close this ticket! Happy New Year everyone and remember to support reddit by giving the gift of gold!

Do you know what VPN software is being used? Do you know what is happening in those 2-5 minutes? I'd visit http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals and use DiskMon and Process Monitor to see if I could work out what was going on.

Holy Christ, I think you're my IT guy. We have the exact same problem.
-------------
Are there any add-ins doing some type of validation or something else? 
-------------
That's a great idea. Since I'm a tier 1 tech, I will check if I have the proper privileges. Also, its been a slow week with the holiday. I'll let you know what I find next week. thank you!

Thanks for Gold kind donater!

Geoff?

All are disabled. :(
-------------
haha, I guess not. It looks like we just have the same PC configuration (and problems) in common!
-------------
Awww and I thought it was going to be one of those reddit-to-real life moments. In any event, if your guys figure it out, please let me know! :) There will be gold in them there hills...

A similar but unrelated issue we had involved a macro that was reaching out to an image file (our logo for branding purposes) on the server. This was fixed by moving the logo file to each person's hard drive. 
-------------
There were not any macros or images associated with the Excel files but its worth a look. Thanks!
