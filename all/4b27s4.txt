What's the quickest way you have found to crash excel (no macros/VBA or external connections)

No reason. Just was wondering

I know that the better your computer, the harder it would be  but for me copying a formula into thousands(haven't checked the exact number) of cells does it quite well but it takes a while to calculate and realise it can't keep it up




-------------
Open Excel on my Mac.
-------------
Use my work computer. 
-------------
Put 1 in A1.  In A2 put `=A1+1`.

Fill to the very very last cell down, (easy, few button presses) and very right cell. 

Watch the CPU spike and excel crash - couldn't even start doing it on my Intel Core i7 with 24GB RAM
-------------
Say the magic words, "almost done" and voila! Excel crashes 
-------------
In VBA, forget to add DoEvents

Do until X=0
  X=X+1
Loop
-------------
Array formulas in 100,000+ cells.  Something like this used to do the trick for me: {=INDEX($C$1:$C$51,SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$51="March",ROW($A$1:$A$51),""),3),1)}
-------------
Any time I go more than 5 minutes without saving, it seems to crash on me.
-------------
My work computer is pretty badass, 100s of 1000s of lookups and it hardly breaks a sweat. Copying a sheet of data and trying to open a new book, however, seems to be its kryptonite.

FTFY.
-------------
What does DoEvents do? The macro is on a never ending loop but why would it crash Excel? Because it is using up memory?
-------------
DoEvents isn't the critical problem there, even with a DoEvents line you'll still get a crash when the size of X exceeds the memory allocated to the variable.

DoEvents lets Excel process other actions while inside of a loop. Useful when doing [real-time animation in Excel](http://carywalkin.ca/2013/06/28/vba4play-part-2-animation-in-excel/).
