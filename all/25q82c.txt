Removing Both Duplicates of a Large List

I have two email lists:

One is all accounts and the other is of active accounts.

I'd like to merge both lists together and then remove any names that appear more than twice (effectively filtering out only inactive accounts).

The remove duplicates function doesn't work because I'd like to remove both the duplicate AND the original.

Is there a quick way to do this? I tried highlighting duplicates with the intention of sorting by highlight cell, but the number of unique names crashes excel. 

Thanks a bunch.


-------------
Get them all into one big list, put it all in column A for example, starting A2.

Put this in B2 (next to first name) and use formula

    =COUNTIF(A:A,A2)

And fill down to the bottom.

Use AutoFilter to filter out anything except 1 values.

Delete all the 2s,3s,4s etc.

Edit: it will search for the value in A2 in the whole A column
Edit2: Numpty got range and and criteria wrong way around

I'm confused...  If you merge them, and remove ones that are not active, you'll end up with just the active accounts list again...
-------------
Quick question:

So right now the list is:

Column A: username
Column B: Email
Column C: Date created

If I want to use the countif for username - what would be the formula be?
-------------
Poor explanation on my part. It should read "effectively leaving only inactive accounts on the list"
-------------
Oh wait, I made a mistake in the original formula. It should target A2 in A:A. See above.
-------------
In that case, do what /u/epicmindwarp says :)
-------------
Append *all accounts* to the end of *active accounts* leaving an easily found gap or change in format. Remove duplicates. Then remove the *active accounts* bit, leaving inactive accounts.
-------------
Any idea why it returned everything as "1"?

I even double checked duplicates to make sure there weren't any spacing issues.

There are definitely names I see appearing 2x in column A but it only has 1 in the countif, which doesn't make sense.
-------------
Hit F9 and let me know what happens.
-------------
F9 without a specific cell selected = nothing

F9 after double-clicking on the CountIF formula returns an error that reads:

"Formula is too long. Formulas may not exceed 8192 characters"
-------------
I have no idea what you're doing, F9 re-calculates every cell automatically.

Are all the duplicate names exactly the same or are there subtle differences?
-------------
Exactly the same.

So definitely will see two versions of "epicmindwarp" in column A (verified no phantom spaces etc), but the COUNTIF (A2,A:A) only returns as "1".

Very strange :(

I'm a frigging numpty.

Use this:

    =COUNTIF(A:A,A2)
-------------
You're making me look bad you numpty!
-------------
Numpty? You seem to smart for me - especially when I don't even understand your words :P

Thank you so much for the assistance. That worked perfectly! I just need to do it piece-meal since the list is so big it keeps crashing Excel.
