freeze

Need help freezing the headers of a column, but I have other info in those rows I don't want to freeze.

I read about the freeze rows and columns tool, but that isn't giving me what I want. My issue is:

- I have a header and then hundreds of rows and info

- But I also have tables and charts to the right of that in the same rows.

- If I freeze the headers, the charts still "scroll" away.

I want the header and the charts to be locked and always visible, but to be able to scroll the rows of info.

Even better than that would be have the chart always stay scrolled to the bottom, so when I need to enter more info, I don't need to scroll all the way down again.

Im logging the time of an event, and have it auto output the date and day, then am showing that in several different charts and tables. Is there a better way to go about doing this?

[Here is a pic of my sheet](http://i.imgur.com/zxNCMgx.png), you can see the layout and why just freezing the header row wont work.

Freeze Panes.  See if this helps.  https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Freeze-panes-to-lock-rows-and-columns-dab2ffc9-020d-4026-8121-67dd25f2508f

Personally though, I would keep my data on one sheet and keep all the charts/reporting on a summary tab.

Seems like you want only the data to scroll.  You could create a scrolling table like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7tdtJsaVUI).  But that necessitates moving your data to a separate sheet and you've indicated you don't want to do that.

As far as I know there's no way to freeze an "L" shaped area like you want.

I've tried freezing just the panes, but I get the same result, the charts wont freeze.

I'm not against another sheet, just not use how to reference that in.

Did you try the "Split pane" option? It might not be exactly what you're looking for but it's a step closer.

I would 2nd splitting charts onto a different sheet, though
-------------
You have to move the graphs entirely onto the frozen section
-------------
you could make a hyper link to the charts and graphs that are on the other sheet.

Yea but then I have to freeze like 20 rows of data also
