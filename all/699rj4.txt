Excel screen seems to freeze but I can still edit cells in the background

I have encountered a strange issue in Office 16 excel where multiple times a day the excel screen itself freezes to where nothing shown will change. I can still click cells, with no outline, or say highlight a group of cells but I won't be able to see the results. I can also save each workbook without issue but the only way I can resolve the issue is to save then close every open workbook to theoretically reset excel. 

Is there a common fix or is the issue well known to where a fix will be released soon? I tend to have many workbooks open at once and this issue has gotten old real quick. 


-------------
Are there any macros running? It may be bad code that forgot to turn ScreenUpdating back on.
-------------
Disable hardware acceleration

I have the exact same issue with Excel 16.  I do not use a lot of macros but I seem to see this more regularly with shared network files with LOTS of links to other files... 

Do you have Windows 10 by chance? Recently got new laptop and didn't have issue on old laptop with Windows 7
-------------
Unfortunately I have a ton, simple ones written by a coworker, and then much more complicated ones written by my company as add-ons. My old computer with Excel 2010/2013 had no such issue with the same macros. 
-------------
Just checked, it is already disabled.

I do have Windows 10. I believe my old laptop wad windows 10 but the older excel. The issue started from day 1 of the new laptop.

You can search the project for screenupdating

What does turning it on do?
-------------
I'll give it a go and see what happens. I currently don't know how to duplicate the issue.
