Have two very large lists of names need to sort the duplicates

I have to make 3 lists for my job and I've never been a wiz at excel, I need to have a list of names that are on both lists, a list of names that are only on one and then a list of names that are only on the other. These two lists both have 900+ names and I don't want to spend the next 8 hours only doing this.


-------------
Where A1 is the value you are searching for, and the list you are searching for it in is in column C

    =MATCH(A1,C:C,0)

This will return the row number it is found on, or an #N/A if it isn't found.  So, where you get a number, that item will be in both lists, and where you get an error, it is just in that list.
-------------
What version of Excel are you using? There is a button called "Remove Duplicates" in the Data ribbon in Excel 2010.
-------------
What are the chances you'd be willing to throw the lists into Access? You could do [left, inner, and right joins](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/Visual_SQL_Joins/Visual_SQL_JOINS_orig.jpg) really easily to get your lists.

EDIT: Looks like you can [join worksheets](http://superuser.com/questions/420635/how-do-i-join-two-worksheets-in-excel-as-i-would-in-sql) in Excel too!

> =MATCH(A1,C:C,0)

Is there anyway to set it to say the name of the duplicate for me? instead of the row it is located on?
-------------
There's also a function in Conditional Formatting to just highlight the duplicates.
-------------
But it would be exactly equal to the thing in A1?  Just filter to display numbers and get the values from column A.

Nvm, using your fomula I was able to work it out. Thank you !
-------------
It being a duplicate of A1 would be perfect, then I would be able to just copy this list down and be done with it.
-------------
but you'd still need to filter or sort. it'll work, trust me.
