long time

How do I calculator time worked, with a start and end time, minus a value (30 to 90) for a lunch break? (Without needing to know when a break started or ended; only needing to know how long it was).

All of the guides I've found on google are if you know the start time, end time, lunch start time, and lunch end time. I'm not really sure what else I should try and google, but if I did I might not be posting here.

I want to have four rows (technically five, but the top is just a label for the date). The first three would be manually entered, and the last one would be calculated from the others.

Time in  
Time out  
Lunch duration  
Time worked  

I can get the time worked (ignoring lunch) by doing (time out) - (time in), but then I get stuck here and don't know how to subtract the lunch duration from that.

Excel handles time in fractions of days. For example, 12pm is ".5"

This is because, under the formatting, excel handles dates as "the number of days since Jan 0, 1900" (yes, 0, that's not a typo)

So, 12pm June 5th 2017 is "42891.5"

Knowing this, if you have the lunch duration in minutes, you can do TimeOut - Time In - [lunch duration in minutes]/60/24

Edit: alternatively, you can use the excel TIME(h,m,s) function you do the calculation for you. You could then do, assuming your column label is A1 and lunch duration is in minutes, "A3 - A2 - TIME(0, A4, 0)"
