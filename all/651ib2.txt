Excel crashes with Powerpivot, but IT won't let me get 64 bit office. Any other way to fix this?

I have constant crashes in Excel. I'm working in a 12 tab workbook with 12 sales tables that have about 30 columns of data (although not many rows yet). I need to create a pivot with relationships but either powerpivot won't open or excel freezes and crashes. I should note, Excel will crash on me with a standard workbook as well..Just not as often. I'm on 2013. Any thoughts?


-------------
Could try disabling hardware acceleration. It messes with some of my workbooks with conditional formatting or powerpivot.
-------------
How big is the workbook in terms of file size? 
-------------
I believe it's only 14 mb right now.

That's very, very large. The reason your workbook is crashing is likely due to some combination of formulas/formatting, not because of 32bit excel.
