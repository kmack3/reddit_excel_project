How do you go about troubleshooting ungodly slow Workbooks?

I'm stumped on a particular workbook why it is so slow.  Not a code issue, no arrays, no sum products.  Next on the to-do list is start deleting one column at at time looking for the offender.

How do you personally go about troubleshooting?


-------------
Put it in Access.

when having if formulas check for cells, put iferror first. if the cell is empty then the workbook should speed up. also try working around vlookups, they can slow down your workbook

I know it might sound too easy, but try copying the data and formatting into a new workbook.

Before Christmas a friend sent me a workbook with something like 100 rows, and 25 columns, on a single worksheet with no VBA, but caused Excel to max out a CPU core. The file was massive for the amount of data it contained, so I started removing the conditional formatting, formatting of unused rows etc, figuring that the smaller file would help.

When that didn't seem to work, I started on the formulae. Even when I'd got the whole thing down to unformatted values the problem persisted.

As a last ditch attempt I tried copying the data and formatting out to a clean workbook, and it started behaving.

Do you have any links to external data? (Auto calc + external links can be a pain)
  
As others have said, maybe try copying to a new workbook; file corruptions can be a major symptom of unnecessarily slow workbooks.
  
  
Try forcing calculations within each sheet, one sheet at a time. (VBA)

Figure it out?

Yeah, no kidding.

Highlighting the row after your last and selecting all of the way to the end of the sheet (ctrl+shift+down) and then deleting or clearing, and then repeating with the columns to the right instead of down will have the same effect.

I inherited a spreadsheet with thousands of vlookups that ran incredibly slow once, but you're almost definitely right about it being a problem with too many active cells and thus too large a spreadsheet. In my experience it happens when you accidentally format a cell in some zany location and Excel uses all the rows/columns inbetween that an your data.

I'll give this a go today.

I was doing it as a favor for someone and it is really low on my priority list so I haven't gotten back to it yet.  I plan on trying a copy - paste into a new workbook.

For any future readers, this is also known by me as the Ctrl+End test.

Ctrl+End will hop you to your last active cell, if it isn't the intersection of the last row & column you use, your sheet is more active cells than you think and it's slowing you down.
