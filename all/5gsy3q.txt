File crashes every time I update annual results, results in tables linked to graphs

Hi all,

I am trying to update a file with this year's enrollment information but if I try and shift all of the data to the left one column, the file crashes. Instead I have to cut and paste each column to the left one at a time and then I have to go back to the graphs and change the reference data each time since it has a missing reference now.  Is there an easier way to do this? I have over 50 tables to update and each graph has 3 variables it shows results for....
