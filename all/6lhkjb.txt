freeze

Simple question - Can you freeze both row 1 and column A?

I hope I got that the right way around! I'm currently using the latest version of Excel for mac and under the View tab, there are buttons to freeze first row and freeze first column, but when I try and use them, it seems they are mutually exclusive - I click one and the other one deselects.

So, is there another way to get round this?

Thanks guys!

Yes. Select cell B2 then select Freeze Panes.

Boom.

Yes! I just found out the other week. Highlight whatever cell you want and click freeze cell. Excel should auto freeze everything left of that cell's column and everything above that cell's row.  Let me know if it gives you any trouble

Yes! That did it! Thank's buddy!
