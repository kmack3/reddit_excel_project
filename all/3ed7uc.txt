Looking for a way to freeze a group of rows/columns in place so they do not scroll.


[Here is my screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/d4h0r5q.jpg)

Is there a way for me to freeze the L-Q/4-6 box so that is stays in place as the user scross up or down through the book? There is information that is to be placed in N5-7 that needs to be referenced later in the doc and it would be nice not to have to scroll up and back down constantly. I've already frozen the top row, if that matters - thank you in advance!


-------------
Unfreeze the top row, select the whole 7th row(click on the number 7 where the row numbers are), select the "View"tab, select "Freeze Panes" in the "Windows" box, select "Freeze Panes".

Note: Do not select freeze top row
-------------
Just to expand on the previous answer:

Clicking in cell A7 would have the same effect. When you choose the 'Freeze Panes' option, the freeze always goes *before* the cell you've got selected; that is, *above* and to the *left*.

This means that if you click in, for example, C7, then choose 'Freeze Panes', you'll have columns A and B, and rows 1-6 frozen. 

I know it's more than you needed, but just for future reference - I always think it's quite useful to know the theory behind what you're asking, as well as the answer :)

thanks!
