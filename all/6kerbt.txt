Extremely slow excel sheet. How to solve this issue?

My excel sheet is only 100 kb and has just 4 sheets, but it is very slow. I do not have that many data sets, at most 100 rows and 26 columns. I have no macros, but many nested formulas. Is there any way to clean it up and make it update faster?

Edit: I just saved the file as 97-2003 excel file and it much faster now. 


-------------
Give us examples of the formulas you use. Maybe they are written very inefficiently.
-------------
Simplify the formulas.

What are the formulas?
-------------
What conditional formatting have you got? What named ranges have you got?

I think they are. A lot of IF statements. Please see my comment below.

This is my longest formula:


    =IFERROR(-IF(C26+1=age;$AC$82)+IF($C26>=age;$F25*(1+return)-G26;$F25*(1+return)+FV(mon_return;12;-mon_invest;0;1)-IF($AC$6=1;$Y$16;0));"")


Most of the formulas are a shorter version of the one above.

I just solved the problem. It is much faster using a 97-2003 file. And all of the functions work. Do you know why?
-------------
FV looks like the tricky one here...
-------------
Can't without any more diagnostics.

Oh, my mistake. I have corrected it now. should be

     =FV(mon_return;12;-mon_invest;0;1)

But I don't think that is the problem
