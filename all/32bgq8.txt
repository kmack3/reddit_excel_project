freeze

[Help] Whenever I paste text from a website excel freezes for a bit! Ugh!

I don't know how best to describe this other then when I copy something from a browser (Chrome, Internet Explorer) into Excel it tries to bring along the source formatting as best it can -- drives me nuts. I just want to paste in the plain text and I don't care if it was , black, blue, red or bold on the site I copied it from or had a bunch of unnecessary padding.  

But further to that is there a way to make it STOP messing with website content? I don't want it to call the webpage up to check the formatting or anything else stupid like that. It's getting to be insane and each paste locks it up for a good 20 or 30 seconds unnecessarily when all I really want is the SKU I copied from a site. For one or two items it was no huge deal but I'm trying to make a shopping list and it's going to take another few hours if it does this each time.

Paste special -> values

Sweet! Thanks :)

One other question. When I click a link it should just open, but instead Excel does some funky business... no idea what. I click the link. I wait 10 seconds. Then it opens. If it were a desktop shortcut it would be instant.

Is there a way to stop that madness?

I think that's just a lag between excel -> your internet browser.

Are you using chrome?

Interesting question. Yes, I'm using Chrome... is that the reason for the lag? :(
