Little (big) data - correlation analysis

I have a what I would consider a large amount of data. It covers various related metrics at the lowest level possible for as far back as I can go.

I pulled all this into one gigantic "data lake"

I would like to be able to pinpoint interesting correlations and help locate what is driving one of my expense costs. Aside from using the correlation equation in excel or graphing them vs the expense one at a time; Does anyone have any tips or excel addins that could assist?
Thanks-

Thanks mig, I have that one loaded for my histograms. I'll take a closer look at it.
