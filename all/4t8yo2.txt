slow

Excel runs slow if it is left open for a while.

This started about a week ago. 

When I open excel everything will run fine but, after a while all excel files will start running slow with about a second lag. When i exit out of the files and reopen them everything will run fine until it happens again. 

I have checked the settings and as far as i can tell everything is the same as always and auto save is at set at every 10 min.

This is on a work computer so i won't be able to try anything until Monday.

One possible solution is to set your formula calculation to manual.  This makes Excel run MUCH faster.  However, formulas will not calculate automatically.

I use this as my default setting and press ALT+F9 to recalculate the sheet or ALT+SHIFT+F9 to recalculate the entire workbook.

I'll give that a try
