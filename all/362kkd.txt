Very slow webservice() function

I just recently upgraded my computer and had to reinstall windows and excel 2013.  Before I had a workbook that had maybe a couple thousand webservice() functions to pull in a lot of information.  It definitely had a little bit of lag but not too bad (maybe 10 seconds or so).  

Now after reinstalling windows and excel even refreshing just one of these cells takes around 10 seconds.  I made a workbook with just one use of the function to make sure it wasn't trying to do all of them.  My cpu usage doesn't go up at all, nor does memory usage.  Its just really slow.  The website I'm pulling from loads almost instantly in a browser so I dont think its the problem.

I dont think I changed any settings on my old install so I'm not sure what could be different.  Does anyone have an idea what might be effecting it?
