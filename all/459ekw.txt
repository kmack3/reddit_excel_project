We have a slow Excel reaction for only 1 of 3 users in the network. That's strange?

Hi!

We have got a network at work, where nobody has any problems except for 1 user. It takes multiple seconds sorting through files and it reacts slow when typing. Any idea what the cause of this could be? I'll give as many details as I can:

- She uses Windows 7, and Excel 2010. 

- The file extensions is xslx

- We do not have any an overly large files, about 4 Mb max, some formula's, no macro's

- She stopped opening multiple excel files at the same time, so that's not it either

- The file is shared, but none of the other users have a slow reaction time, and the rate at which things are changed in the file is only a few lines per day.

- The only other program that takes up some memory is Thunderbird, at a rate of about 500 Mb


We tried asking our Tech guys, bot nobody can find the problem. Any ideas?
