Help reducing large =If function

Hi, as the title says, can't link tonight will throw some pics up in the morning.

I have a box e.g. A1, and rows of categories, eg. A3:V4 
Each category is an upper or lower tolerance limit,eg:
0 3  6  10  15.....
3 6 10 15 22.....

I am currently using an embedded if, with 20 embeds along the lines of:
=if(and(a1>=a3,a1<a4),1,if(and(a1>=b3,a1<b4),2,=if(and(a1>=c3,a3<c4),1.........,"err"))))

I get I could have used and(a1>=a3,a1<b3) but I've done it now, plus same ends, different means..

Anyway, is there a simpler way??
I thought of doing a look up, but A1 could be a decimal and didn't want a massive table.

Any ideas? 

Thanks

You could replace your and statements with MEDIAN(A1,A3,A4)=A1, which will evaluate TRUE if A1 is bound by A3 and A4.

I'm not sure what the output of your IF statements represents, the 1, 2, 3 etc but perhaps it could be simplified even more.  
-------------
If it isn't broken, why fix it?
-------------
You could try

    =IF(COUNTIFS(A3:Z3,"<="&A1,A4:Z4,">"&A1),MATCH(1,INDEX((A3:Z3<=A1)*(A4:Z4>A1),0),0),"err")

Pictures/links will help because it's not easy to determine what you're doing.

However, if it's just upper/lower limits, I think MATCH() will do what you need pretty easily. 
-------------
More data would be useful. I cannot see what you are trying to achieve overall. 
-------------
Yeah, Looks similar length though. I was kind of hoping for a 'between' function with a large array, but couldn't find anything on Google.

The output, 1,2,3 etc reflect a vlookup column reference for the data table below cells a3:v4

Thanks

Striving for perfection! And if I distribute I'd like people to understand.

Match() sounds interesting, I'll give that a look. Thanks 
-------------
I just looked at this online, and I think it will remove the need for the if function at all as I can embed into the vlookup. Thanks! I'll try it and verify at work 
-------------
Imgur blocked at work.... any ideas how to share? :S

Solution Verified

I am just filling up your inbox now, but thanks, match works perfectly and gets rid of the whole IF function. 

so now I will inbed the Match in the Vlookup formula to avoid hidden/locked cells

thanks again

Well, that's what MEDIAN does, returns the value in the middle. :-)

Can you throw up a screen shot?  I'm having a hard time understanding what the output from the IFs represents. 
-------------
Maybe so,  but the computer can't tell the difference and the output works. 

Your back end can look like a cyborg vomited a tentacle monster,  as long as your front end looks like a pagent model it doesn't matter, beauty is literally skin deep in software, as long as it all works.

Sure thing, but it will have to be tomorrow. I'll upload some grabs when I get so work. 
Thanks for your help
