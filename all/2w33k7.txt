Created a button using VBA. It has worked for a long time, suddenly today it became unclickable. Has anyone run into this before?

I have a button I made in VBA that has been working for months. Today I open the spreadsheet and all of a sudden, the button is unclickable. When I highlight my mouse over the button, the cursor turns into a big white plus sign.

I've tried to enable macros in the security settings, and allow all VBA code. I've also tried toggling on and off in design mode. Has anyone run into this issue before? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: To add to this issue - If I try to insert a new button, I recieve a pop error saying "Cannot insert object".

2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th this right here. Working in a large enterprise of over 15,000++ people I've been dealing with this headache for months now. The vba works - your system upgrades do not.

Thank you for this information!

Unfortunately, the VBA workbooks I've written are used by my whole department at work. So even if I uninstall an update on my own computer... I have a feeling I won't be able to get these workbooks to function across the rest of the department.
