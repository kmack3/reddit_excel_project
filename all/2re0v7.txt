VLOOKUP loop in VBA with multiple worksheets? (Using "LARGE" function)

Hello,

I'm having some trouble writing VBA code for a VLOOKUP loop for a basketball database. Here is the formula that I want to apply to multiple worksheets:

(the formula and output is in cell AH2, where I want it to be on every worksheet)

=VLOOKUP(LARGE($B$2:$B$110, 1), $B$2:$AG$110, 32, FALSE)

Now, I want the "1" in the LARGE command to loop 10 times... For i = 1 To 10. But I need the 10 results to be averaged out into 1 number that is displayed into cell AH2 (on all of my hundreds of worksheets) Huge props if you can solve it! !

For the future, rather than the copy/paste 10x, you can use:

    =SUMPRODUCT((ag2:ag110)*(b2:b110=LARGE(b2:b110,{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10})))/10
-------------
While this can be obviously be done in VBA, the easiest way might be to simply write a long function, just add "+" to the end of your formula, copypaste 9 times more, change the second parameter of your LARGE function with 2 to 10 and divide the whole thing by 10.

A tip if you want to use VBA: Application.WorksheetFunction allows you to use Excel functions in VBA.

Wow.  Never knew about the large function.  Mind blown.  I was using a series of array formulas for this.

ThisWorkbook.Sheets.("SheetName").Range("A1") would refer to cell A1 on sheet named SheetName.

Edit: Note that you can also use the index of the sheet instead of its name.

SheetName!A1

or 'Sheet name'!A1 if there are spaces in the sheet name
