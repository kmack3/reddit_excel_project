Excel crashes when trying to refresh more than 4 web queries

I've created about 20 web queries to different sites that house NFL information. After each week, I go in and refresh these queries then put it through a data prep program that formats into one nice database to allow for visualization of the data. If I do them in chunks of 4, they refresh no problem. If I hit refresh all, it crashes Excel every time. 

I've seen a number of different Macros that may help with it, and I'm familiar with macros, but I couldn't figure out how to tailor them from Database queries to web queries. Any thoughts/help is appreciated. 

Thanks!


-------------
Given that controlling the refresh rate seems to do something for you, I would try that idea in code. 

The basic model is to loop through the worksheets and call <sheet name>.QueryTables(1).Refresh. This way at least you know for sure only one web call is happening at a time. 

Of course this assumes you have one web query per sheet, you will want to bypass sheets with no QueryTables.
