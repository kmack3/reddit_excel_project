freeze

Need to freeze the contents of a cell from changing in subsequent openings of the file.

So for instance I want a 'Date formulated' blank and then have it =TODAY() but I only want it to change once (the date it's created) and never change again.  

Basically I'm creating an invoicing template and want to automate portions of it, but the automated cells change for anyone opening it later. Need to know how to freeze it so it remains consistent to the original information for people opening it later.

You can make a simple UDF 
    Function UDFNOW() As Date
    UDFNOW = NOW()  ' or TODAY()
    End Function
Put =UDFNOW() in your cell and format it as Date. It won't change.

There's a slightly more complex way involving enabling iteration if you're unwilling to use VBA.

In File Options Formulas enable iteration.
Type this into cell E9. 
=IF(B9<>"",IF(E9="",NOW(),E9),"")
Now type something into B9. Enabling iteration can have some unintended consequences if you're sloppy coding your sheet.
