While wend macro crashes excel

I have an xslm file that takes a external .xslx , divides it in tabs and saves the tabs as separate .xlsx files. Next step is running through all those files, making tabs in them and cleaning up empty columns. I have problems with the running through all the files part.  The littelfiles.total runs without problems.
I tinkered on this code for a long time and after discovering that my arrays loaded the same time I fixed it. Last time I managed to run it, I saw it being filled with the right files.
Since then excel crashes from the instant I run this part. Is there an infinite loop I'm not seeing? Can anyone help?

I tried compiling, saving the code in notepad and making a new file and i have no plug ins that i know of.

the "code" is the following:

    Sub OpenAllFiles2()
    'create an array
    Dim myFiles As Variant
    ReDim myFiles(500)

    myPath = ThisWorkbook.path & "/" & "Department"

    If Right(myPath, 1) <> "\" Then 
    myPath = myPath & "\"
    End If


    'search for at least 5 files in the folder specified above, add the entire path     to the array
    While myCount < 5
       potentialFileToLoad = Dir(myPath & "*.xlsm")
        While potentialFileToLoad <> ""
            myFiles(myCount) = myPath & potentialFileToLoad
            myCount = myCount + 1
            potentialFileToLoad = Dir
        Wend
        Wend

    'change size of array to ammount of files found
    ReDim Preserve myFiles(myCount - 1)


    For Each ii In myFiles

    '(Insert Open, Run code, close code here)
    Workbooks.Open (ii), True, True

    Call LittleFiles.total

    ActiveWorkbook.Close (False)

    Next ii

    End Sub

    Sub go()
    Call OpenFiles
    Call OpenAllFiles2
    End Sub



-------------
I think this is happening  

    potentialFileToLoad = Dir(myPath & "*.xlsm")
    While potentialFileToLoad <> ""
        myFiles(myCount) = myPath & potentialFileToLoad
        myCount = myCount + 1
        potentialFileToLoad = Dir
    Wend

If there are .xslm files in myPath, *potentialFileToLoad* will always be not empty and it will stay stuck in this While-Wend.  
Put a Watch on pFTL and see if and how it changes.  
If it does return 'Empty' are you sure you can test for that with <>"" ? It might need to be tested with IsEmpty().  
Another thing that I miss is you declaring myCount as 0.   
  
  
While your code looks fine I think you should check this one out though:

1. I ***highly*** recommend using the Option Explicit flag in all your documents as it will reduce the number of errors you may get from misusing variables.

2. In this situation, I recommend using the FileSystemObject, versus Dir.

3. You don't need arrays to make this all work properly.

4. You definitely should use tab indentation for better code readability.

5. If you have less than 5 files in your mypath directory, your code will continue in an endless loop.

6. Try the following to see if it works as intended with your code:


    Option Explicit
    
    Private Sub OpenAllFiles()
        Dim myPath As String
        myPath = ThisWorkbook.Path & "/" & "Department"
        
        Dim sFileName As Variant
        Dim FSO:        Set FSO = CreateObject("scripting.FileSystemObject")
        Dim oFolder:    Set oFolder = FSO.GetFolder(myPath)
        
        For Each sFileName In oFolder.Files
            Select Case sFileName
                Case myPath & "\~$" & ThisWorkbook.Name     'Skip this since it's the document's temp file
                Case myPath & "\" & ThisWorkbook.Name       'Skip this since it is this document
                Case Else
                    Workbooks.Open myPath & "\" & sFileName, True, True
                    Call LittleFiles.Total
                    ActiveWorkbook.Close (False)
            End Select
        Next
    End Sub
