Extracting large table of numbers from pdf to calculate totals in Excel

I have a handful of pdf files containing mixed lists of miles, square miles, and acres of water bodies in Massachusetts sorted by their level of impairment, and need to get totals for each of 5 impairment categories broken down by the different units. Right now I'm going page by page and manually noting these numbers into excel, where I can get totals, but this is incredibly time-consuming. Does anyone have a suggestion for turning these tables into workable excel documents so that I can sort by unit and get totals more quickly?

You can't just select text in the PDF, copy, and paste in?

There are some tools out there that convert pdfs to different formats.  Someone already mentioned adobe acrobat(download the trial).  You could also try a round about way using OCR.  You will probably find no matter the choice it will get like 80% right and the rest you are stuck doing it by hand.  If you cant get the source files that made the pdfs it is what it is.
-------------
The process of converting from PDF to anything is a ridiculously inaccurate process. You are better off copying and pasting it out and using a macro to sort out the formatting.

Depending on how much this is worth to you, there is an [application that'll do it, but it is NOT cheap.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_%28software%29)

Problem is that most PDFs store the data itself, and where on the page it should be displayed... so when you copy it out, that location data doesn't come with it.

Monarch allows you to "scan" the PDFs, and keep, then extract, the location data.

I think a license is something like $2k?

If you have Adobe Acrobat (not reader) you may be able to open it and Save-As into Excel format.

No, it loses all its formatting and I can't seem to be able to reconstruct it.

I actually found that for $21/year, you can get an Adobe Acrobat add-on that transfers PDFs to Word or Excel formats, and you can get a full refund within 30 days. Works pretty well.
-------------
Ctrl-C in the PDF (open in Adobe Acrobat, not inside a browser window if opening from the web), then in Excel, click the paste button arrow, then "Text import wizard".

You may need a small amount of cleanup, but it's easy enough.
