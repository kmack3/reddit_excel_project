long time

Have pulled data into Power Query. Would like to take what's in columns G & H and combine them, either by putting stuff in H into G after the stuff there now, or by making the table twice as long, and having a new column have column G's data half the time and column H's data the other half. How?

That all made sense in my head.

Basically I have imported data into Power Query. I'm looking at the first 100 rows now. The first column (A, though I know the letters aren't there until I close & load the data into Excel), is sort of like the 'key' - it's the thing that's unique on each row. Rows B thru F is irrelevant for purposes of this question. Rows G and H have data in them that I want to combine. I'd like this query to end with twice as many rows as it has now, with a column that contains everything that's now in row G and row H, whether it's alternating like shuffled cards, or all the H data after all the G data - whatever. But I need to have it done inside the Query Editor so that this is refreshable.

This is very hard to visualize without sample data of what you have, and what you want to happen :(

Ok here's how I would tackle this. Query 1 open the data and I delete columns B through F and then delete column H. Save as a connection. Next, do Query 2 the same way except delete column G, but leave H. Save as a connection. Next do an APPEND query select Query 1 and then select Query 2, save to Worksheet.

I hope this makes sense:

What I have is this, where "X" is just data I can live without-

    A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H
    17   X    X    X    X    X    Blue Green
    19   X    X    X    X    X    Blue Yellow
    22   X    X    X    X    X    Red  Purple
    23   X    X    X    X    X    Blue Orange
    27   X    X    X    X    X    Red  Blue
    28   X    X    X    X    X    Blue Red

And this is what I'd like to create from that, either in this order or in some other order:

    Blue
    Blue
    Red
    Blue
    Red
    Blue
    Green
    Yellow
    Purple
    Orange
    Blue
    Red

Tried it and that doesn't work. I get the data from column G in the new sheet's column A, and then the data from column H in the new sheet's column B starting with the row after the first data ends. I need them both in the same column.

Unpivot G and H

You will end up with "Attribute" and "Value" columns.

If you don't need it in original order, delete everything except Value Column and you're done.

If you need it in original order, Sort the Attribute column first, then Column A. Then delete everything except Value Column, and you're done.
-------------
You did a merge query and not an append query. If you don't need the key in column A, delete it in both of the "connection only" queries.
