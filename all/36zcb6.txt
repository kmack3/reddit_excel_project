Index/Match - Array formula too slow

Hello /r/excel! 

I am currently working on  project that involves one sheet with 40,000+ rows of data (ID #, Name, Date, etc.) and while none of the rows are exact duplicates, the ID #'s (which is my lookup value) have multiple repeats. In my other sheet, I have an array formula to lookup the ID number input in one cell and return all the Name corresponding to each instance of that ID number. I then have normal Vlookups pull the remaining data based on what appears from the array formula. This process works, however it is unbearably slow (seemingly because of the array). I was wondering if there is a better way to do this either with VBA or with another formula? Sorry if this is a bit confusing, and if needed I can provide an example, however my project contains sensitive information so I would have to create one from scratch. Thanks!

Index/Match arrays are memory hogs plain and simple. Depending upon your workbooks setup I would say look into managing your worksheets Application.Calculation settings via VBA and converting to text values after the calculations have taken place. The other half of me wants to see your formulas - it takes Excel less memory to run through one complex super long formula then it would that same logic broken out into smaller chunks over multiple cells - so the fact that you are running Index/Match into Vlookup's makes me consider combining them.

Have you considered trying a pivot table with all the data in the rows, first the ID number, then the names, and so on, then you just filter the pivot to get a subset of your data. It mostly depends on how your input data is structured but it could be a possibility.

Sounds like  a pivot table would be *much* easier.

I was doing something similar. I ultimately moved my memory hogging array into a second spreadsheet so that we could enter data into the original, but only suffer the slowdown when we needed the array. 

To my surprise excel opens the first spreadsheet at the speed you would expect, but takes no time at all to open the second sheet and run the calculations. The delay to open these as the same file was nearly a minute, and the entire program lagged like hell, but the two file arrangement runs smoothly the entire time.

I don't know nearly enough about the inner workings of memory management to say why this worked out this way.
