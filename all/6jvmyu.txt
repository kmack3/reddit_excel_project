Excel window lags + high CPU usage spikes

Really bizarre one, I have a relatively powerful PC used mainly for gaming. I recently bought and installed Office 2016 for some personal finance / databasing etc. Using Excel 2016 this evening, the program itself seems to perform fine, but when I moved the application window around my desktop, it lags unbearably and my CPU usage spikes quite high..

If I minimise the window and do the same with any other application, there's no such issue. 

I've tried a few things through Googling - checked for updates, both Office and Windows (10), both up to date; disabled hardware acceleration in Excel options; changed mouse polling rate.. Nothing seems to fix the issue.

It's quite annoying.. Even the Core 2 Duo micro PC I use at work can juggle around half a dozen Office windows without any lag, so this doesn't seem right at all.... Any suggestions?
