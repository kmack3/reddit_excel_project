Our overlords are pleased, and may their gracious hand be forever open...

Good Afternoon/Morning/Evening wonderful persons of /r/Excel!

Our corporate overlords have reached down from the heavens and bestowed upon us a wonderful gift!

We have been given a few spots to this years [ModelOff 2015 Global Training Camp](http://www.gtc.modeloff.com/), and we are hoping to send a couple of you as our representatives and as guests of the Microsoft Development Team.

### What is ModelOff 2015?
Straight from their website:

> ModelOff is an innovative and challenging annual global online competition for professionals and students to develop and test their financial modeling skills against friends, colleagues and top modelers worldwide. Competitors undertake two Online Qualification Rounds before the World’s Top 16 advance to a Live Finals Event held in London..

### When is ModelOff 2015?
> This year ModelOff is December 3-4 2015

### Where is ModelOff 2015?
> London, UK
	
Now on to the tricky part.  We have 3 total spots available, we will be sending one from the moderator team which leaves 2 that we are able to give out.  We are hoping that we have 2 contributors that we can send as /r/Excel representatives.  You will not be competing, just participating in workshops as well as other events throughout the two days.

### Who are we looking for?

> We are looking for active, participating members of the /r/Excel community.  
	 
###  What expenses are covered?

> None.  You will be responsible for all travel, lodging and meals.  The only thing that will be provided is the registration cost to the event.
	 
### Do I have to live in Europe in order to attend?
     
> No, but you will be responsible for all travel cost.
	 
Requirements:

1. We ask that you commit to attending, and representing /r/Excel as a contributor.

2. We ask that if you have any life event that may prevent you from attending at the last minute, you do not express your interest in attending. (On Call jobs, family sickness, new family members)

3. We ask that if you are interested in attending, and can commit to going, please write us a quick note below and let us know.

4. We ask that if you are chosen to attend, that as a representative of Reddit and /r/Excel, you conduct yourself in a way that they will continue to invite us to more events.

If after all that you are still interested in attending, please let us know!

Thanks,

/r/Excel Mod Team

This new baby keeps ruining my life... It's a good thing she's adorable.
-------------
I cannot go, but I wanted to say that I think this is great for /r/Excel! Congratulations to the Mod Team and to the community!
-------------
I'm interested! A bit of a trip for me from California but it'd be fun to learn some new Excel concepts. My local coworkers aren't into it like I so the only fun stuff is what others share online.
-------------
Very interesting.  I'd like to put my name in the hat. I'm on the continent, and could probably write off the travel as a training expense anyways. 

I'm not comfortable sharing my CV publicly here, but I am am in a relevant business field, and could give my details to the mods privately.
-------------
This may be interesting, but i'm not in the financial analyst or the like, but in construction. 

Is being in the financial world a pré or doesn't it matter?
-------------
I can not put my name in the hat, but just want to say this is a great idea -- thank you to all involved in making this real. 
-------------
As posted in another comment in this thread, it seems very interesting to go to London. When will be announced who can go to London? I would like to go but will have to make the necessary preperations. edit: A word
-------------
I think this should be posted in Mr Excel rather.
-------------
3-4 December is quite a bad date, because many people working in finance have the so called "month close" during the first days of the month, when they deal with reports concerning prior months. You obviously will not change the date of your event, but you should consider a more suitable date for the future events.
-------------
congratulations :) 
-------------
pictures plz!
-------------
There's some fun challenges on their "past questions" page, I've gone through a few so far. 

I am definitely going to start pointing people looking to really polish their skills at these.
-------------
There are 3 rooms. 2 of which appear to be finance related, 1 is dedicated to excel and more technical
-------------
A final decision will be made this week.
-------------
Thank you for the suggestion.  This is something that is exclusive to Reddit and /r/Excel.  You can find more information on our relationship with the Microsoft Excel Product Team [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/3lusom/please_welcome_our_new_corporate_overlords/).  There may already be someone in touch with Bill, but we are not part of those conversations.

TL:DR
Microsoft reached out to us as part of an outreach program.  This is one of the first things that has come of our talks with the Microsoft Excel Product Team.
-------------
This event is run by Microsoft, not us.
-------------
Do I hear a motion to implement a "New Baby Pictures Monday" weekly thread?
-------------
Oh, I have photos!  My wife is a professional photographer, so you'll notice the difference in quality between the first few photos you see here and the last.

Count me in then. Sounds awsome to attend.
-------------
No offense I love r/excel for simple things but when comes to feedback on array functions it's Mr Excel maybe theyre more programming types than financial types.
-------------
I have a few hundred to upload!
-------------
Mate, she's adorable!  Very proud daddy I take it?

Here's one of my daughter, 7 months old:

Aww! What a cutie! Congrats mom & dad! 
-------------
None taken!

I am sure Mr. Jelen is going to be attending, as I have seen a few emails on the MVP list bouncing back and forth, but as to Microsoft offering a few spots to the event, I am unaware of any conversation that has been had.
-------------
Oh super proud. Also, your daughter oh my God, so cute. I'd never take her out of that suit.
