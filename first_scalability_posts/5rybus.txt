Need some help consolidating formulas! Big report almost 15mb

Was hoping someone could help me consolidate a few of these long loopy formulas I made that blew up the size of this report I have to just over 15mb. 

This formula is repeated on 950 rows and is along side a big list of PLU's. The formula is meant to identify the Size of the packaging as it's input into our accounting system, and convert that into a normal format that's easy to work with. It's basically a shit ton of IF statements that I need to figure out how to consolidate. 

     =IF(OR(H951="",H951=0),"",IF(AB951="12/22L","12/22",IF(AB951="4/6/12L","4/6/12",IF(AB951=23529,"6/64oz",IF(AB951=42525,"24/16oz",IF(AB951=41064,"6/4/12",IF(AB951=41005,"4/6/12",IF(AB951=43091,"12/22",AB951))))))))

Create a lookup table of those value pairs and use a lookup instead.

Then copy paste special values to reduce size further as required.

-------------
I guess it's not related, but that formula...wow. Ever consider creating a user-defined function?
-------------
Hi,

What result you want, attache an example
-------------
hmmm not a bad idea. I'll give that a shot and see if it'll reduce the file a bit.
-------------
I could but not sure if that would save space since the macro would still have to calculate 950+ times.

I think what a prior user suggested, making a lookup table and using vlookup or index/match might instead of the nested IF statements.

This. There's got to be an easier way.
-------------
The problem you may find is that Undo data remains in the file.. It will shrink file size  further if you then copy the data only to a new Excel file and save it.
-------------
I don't agree. Perhaps OP didn't even know that was possible. I used to create crazy array formulas long and nested and one day a friend said "why don't you just try coding in VBA" ... that suggestion has been the single most useful sentence in my career the last couple of years.  A suggestion is not a bad thing.

+200% - Workbook Bloat is real. Sometimes just transferring to a new workbook can solve a lot of one's problems. Or using different file formats such as XLSB.
-------------
I just wrote that formula into a VBA function and replaced the cells with it. Doing that actually increased the size of the file by 3kb
-------------
Also discovering that your data tab has 70k extra empty lines, and getting rid of them. 
-------------
XLSB is a good idea, it also opens the file faster.
-------------
If you already have the logic you need and it works, you can try putting it into a loop and running it as a subroutine and thereby just set the resulting value to the cells, run it everytime you need an update. 

1. not sure how that affects size of the file and 
2. not sure if it's practical for your use case
-------------
As ny2mad suggested, you can write a procedure to just update the cells with the result instead of a formula.
