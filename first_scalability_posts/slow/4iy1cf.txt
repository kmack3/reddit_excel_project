I have a slow worksheet

I have an excel spreadsheet that I use all day everyday. 

One of the worksheets is text based and has 60,000 rows or so. The last couple of days it's been mega slow just scrolling through it - it takes about 1 second to move one row. 

All the other worksheets are fine. 

I  can't think why this sheet would be slow - it has Conditional Formatting (highlight duplicates) on, and it has a couple of very basic formulas which are applied to all 60,000 rows or so - just add name column to domain column to create email address.

Any way to make this worksheet function properly again?

> Conditional Formatting (highlight duplicates)

a big no no because it requires a recalculation with each update to the spreadsheet.

Conditional formatting can be a son of a bitch. Remove it and only add it back when you need it. As for formulas, I'll usually keep the formula in a cell along a frozen top row,  and then add it back in to the rows only when I need them.

Thanks

OK thanks - how do I remove it?

Is it likely that the conditional formatting has been ok for some time but the 60,000 point is a bit of a stretch for it?

No worries - ive figured out how to turn off conditional formatting (select clear rules)

Seems to be working much better now (although only used it for 5 seconds
