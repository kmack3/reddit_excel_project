ODC connection really slow on Windows 10

Hi there!

One of my user is having issue with an Excel file. When opened, the excel file load 3 ODC as data connection.

This has been working fine for years, but now this guy upgraded to windows 10, and it doesn't work anymore. 

Important Detail :

- The odcs are on a network share. 
- The user is offsite, on a remote plant. But he is on the same network as me.
- The odcs works fine for me.
- If he uses his old computer (Windows 7) it works.
- If I change the file directory of the ODCs from //SERVERNAME/odc.odc to X:\odc.odc and map X to //SERVERNAME, everything works, but it can't be the solution.

When I say it doesnt work, I mean it's so slow that it's not viable. It loads 100 lines per second. When it works, it load like 10000 lines per second.

This issue plagued me all weak, and I can't find a solution.

Thank you for the read!

EDIT : I did more tests :

If I open a new excel file on his computer, and connect the odc with \\servername as file directory for the connection odc, it works..

It seems like the issue is only for this particulare tool. But even after disabling all macros, it still doesn't work.

just a guess... are you entering the fully qualified name?

[Is it running in compatability mode?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2629973/workbooks-are-opened-in-compatibility-mode-excel-2010-or-excel-2007)

-------------
What do you mean by fully qualified name?
-------------
servername.domain instead of just servername
-------------
It doesn't seem to work. Do you use it in the odc path file?

\\Server.domain\odcfolder\odc.odc

?
