Index Match with SumIf lookup column causing slow calculation

I've recently been trying to optimise a workbook that has become sluggish when calculating. I've taken quite a few steps including removing volatile formulas, checking sheet sizes and checking formula dependencies. After taking these steps I believe I've found the cause of the slowdown, but I don't understand why it's happening. The workbook has multiple sheets with tables on them, and the problem seems to be linked to one in particular, a small table called 'Purchase Orders' that is only 174 rows and 24 columns. In another sheet I have around 800 index & match formulas looking at the last column in the Purchase Order table, which contains a simple sumif formula:

    =SUMIF([STOCK_CODE],[@[STOCK_CODE]],[Order Est Duration (WEEKS)])

The index & match formula in the other sheet is also pretty simple:

    =IF([@[CASE ORDER IS:]]>0,INDEX(TBLPurchaseOrder[Total Order Duration (Weeks)],MATCH(TEXT([@[Stock Codes]],"#0"),TBLPurchaseOrder[STOCK_CODE],0)),"")

For some reason, the lookup against the SUMIF formula is causing calculation times to go from almost instantaneous to around 5 seconds long! If I copy & paste the values of the SUMIF, the problem goes away and calculation time is returned to normal.

I know that SUMIF formulas can be taxing for Excel but there are only 174 of them in this case, and after some googling I haven't been able to figure out why this is happening at all, so I thought I'd ask here. Can anyone shed any light on why the SUMIF is affecting the calculation speed in this way?

without seeing your data i couldnt say for sure but you can probably just use a pivot table instead of the index/match and or sumifs.
