Slow Excel Calculation

Hi r/Excel,  

I am noticing that my Excel takes minutes (like 2-10 min) to apply a vLookup or Filter on a spreadsheet with 70-300k rows and 25-50 columns of data, is that normal?  

This particularly happens when I build a new report. The slowdown seems odd since I don't think 300k rows of data is that much. I suspect it is because I am working on a virtual machine, but correct me if I am wrong.

There are no external links, all of the raw data is in the workbook.

I am using a virtual machine with a 4-core processor, Win 10, Excel 2016; if this info helps.

Thanks!

Is your data formatted as a Table? 
I do have anecdotal experience that trying to bulk-update formulas in a table can sometimes take significantly longer than a normal range (though I've never bothered to investigate why, and I've certainly never had anything as dramatic as 10 minutes - I assume the virtual machine is responsible for that bit) :-S

See if this helps: instead of saving your workbook as an .xlsx file, save it as an .xlsb (excel binary). This should significantly reduce the file size, and this can - in some cases - make a difference to processing times.

Hi,  

The data isn't formatted as a table. I've never tried saving as a binary file. I will try that and see how it is.

Thanks
