slow

VBA code works but somewhat slow. Any idea if I can make it faster?

Hi guys. I created a user form that allows me to input my data easily (transfer from an account to an account, buying and selling currencies) and then copy the data to another sheet. However, the copying takes more time than I had thought. I hope someone knows how to tweak the code to make it run faster. Here is the code that I use and the table the code goes into:

The Code:

    Private Sub ExecuteDeal_Click()
    
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        Set ws = Worksheets("Transfers")
        
        'Copy the Data to their fields in the Transfers Worksheet
        
        If txtDealMadeOn <> "" And txtCCYBuy <> "" And txtAmountBuy <> "" And txtAccountBuy <> "" _
        And txtCCYSell <> "" And txtAmountSell <> "" And txtAccountSell <> "" And txtExchangeRate <> "" _
        And txtCounterparty <> "" And txtValueDate <> "" Then
        
            With ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Transfers")
            
                If ws.Range("A53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("A53").Value = CDate(txtDealMadeOn)
                Else
                    ws.Range("A52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = CDate(txtDealMadeOn)
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("B53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("B53").Value = txtCCYBuy
                Else
                    ws.Range("B52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = txtCCYBuy
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("C53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("C53").Value = CDbl(txtAmountBuy)
                Else
                    ws.Range("C52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = CDbl(txtAmountBuy)
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("D53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("D53").Value = txtAccountBuy
                Else
                    ws.Range("D52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = txtAccountBuy
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("E53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("E53").Value = txtCCYSell
                Else
                    ws.Range("E52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = txtCCYSell
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("F53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("F53").Value = CDbl(txtAmountSell)
                Else
                    ws.Range("F52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = CDbl(txtAmountSell)
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("G53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("G53").Value = txtAccountSell
                Else
                    ws.Range("G52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = txtAccountSell
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("H53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("H53").Value = CDbl(txtExchangeRate)
                Else
                    ws.Range("H52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = CDbl(txtExchangeRate)
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("I53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("I53").Value = txtCounterparty
                Else
                    ws.Range("I52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = txtCounterparty
                End If
                
                If ws.Range("J53").Value = "" Then
                    ws.Range("J53").Value = CDate(txtValueDate)
                Else
                    ws.Range("J52").End(xlDown).Offset(1, 0).Value = CDate(txtValueDate)
                End If
            
            End With
            
            'Clear the fields after copying the data
            
            txtDealMadeOn = ""
            txtCCYBuy = ""
            txtAmountBuy = ""
            txtAccountBuy = ""
            txtCCYSell = ""
            txtAmountSell = ""
            txtAccountSell = ""
            txtExchangeRate = ""

                FXMenu.Show
            Else
                FXDealBuy.Show

            txtValueDate = "" Then
                MsgBox "Data is missing. Please double check before adding a FX Deal."
            End If

Turn off screen updating might help if you don't want to dive into the code to much

I'd replace lines 13-75 with this.  Perhaps searching for the right line for each value is taking up time?  All the data should be on the same line, so you'd just need to do it once.

    If ws.Range("A53").Value = "" Then
        i = 53
    Else
        i = ws.Range("A52").Value.End(xlDown).Row + 1
    End If
    
    ws.Range(Cells(i, 1), Cells(i, 10)) = Array(CDate(txtDealMadeOn), _
            txtCCYBuy, CDbl(txtAmountBuy), txtAccountBuy, txtCCYSell, CDbl(txtAmountSell), _ 
            txtAccountSell, CDbl(txtExchangeRate), txtCounterparty, CDate(txtValueDate))    
-------------
Use vbNullString instead of double double quotes.

All your txt values in the workbook should be defined as a range that gets wiped out as one instead of individually.

Every one of your if-then statements that asks if a cell is blank then put the info there otherwise put it in the new last row could be shortened to simply put it in the new last row, as when row 53 for you is blank, it would obey that logic as well.

Your outer IF block has the condition

    txtDealMadeOn <> "" And txtCCYBuy <> "" And txtAmountBuy <> ""
    And txtAccountBuy <> "" And txtCCYSell <> "" And txtAmountSell <> ""
    And txtAccountSell <> "" And txtExchangeRate <> ""
    And txtCounterparty <> "" And txtValueDate <> ""

Your second, inner IF (in the outer one's ELSE section) has the condition

    txtDealMadeOn = "" Or txtCCYBuy = "" Or txtAmountBuy = ""
    Or txtAccountBuy = "" Or txtCCYSell = "" Or txtAmountSell = ""
    Or txtAccountSell = "" Or txtExchangeRate = ""
    Or txtCounterparty = "" Or txtValueDate = ""

which is the logical opposite of the first condition, so it's **necessarily true**, so it's redundant and should be deleted. Just have the Msgbox statement in the ELSE section.

All your references begin with *ws*, so you don't need the With block, but that's not affecting execution speed.

If you have automatic recalculation enabled, try putting the statement

    Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual

near the top of your procedure and

    Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic

near the end of it.

thanks for the link man .. I saved it so I keep using it as well. can I give solution verified to two users?

Wow man .. this made it much faster .. however i had to tweak line 4 and delete the .value 

one thing though .. if i run the code while i was on another sheet besides Transfers .. i get an error on line 7 .. it says "Method 'Range' on object '_Worsheet' failed" any idea how to solve it?

Solution Verified!

As many as you want.

Yes, you're right on removing the .Value, sorry.

above line 7, put in "ws.activate" and it will bring up the transactions tab and then it should work.
