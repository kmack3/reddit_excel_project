VBScript Excel to CSV converter is very slow and Protected view slows it even more

I found a VBScript to convert Excel files to CSV files, and modified it to my needs. The files I'm dealing with are usually in protected view, so I have the following code:

    format = 6
    
    Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    src_file = objFSO.GetAbsolutePathName(Wscript.Arguments.Item(0))
    dest_file = objFSO.GetAbsolutePathName(WScript.Arguments.Item(1))
    
    Dim oExcel
    Set oExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
    
    oExcel.DisplayAlerts = False
    oExcel.ProtectedViewWindows.Open(src_file)
    If oExcel.ProtectedViewWindows.Count > 0 Then
        oExcel.ActiveProtectedViewWindow.Edit
    End If
    Dim oBook
    Set oBook = oExcel.Workbooks.Open(src_file)
    
    oBook.Worksheets(5).Activate
    
    oBook.SaveAs dest_file, format
    
    oBook.Close False
    oExcel.DisplayAlerts = True
    oExcel.Quit 
This script removes the protected view from the Excel files and saves the current selected worksheet as a csv file. If I run this the first time, it takes about 25-27 seconds to convert 4 protected view excel files into csv files. When I run it the second time, where the excel files are no longer in protected view, I get a similar result. I was curious to see what would happen if I removed the checking for Protected View, so I did the following:

    format = 6
    
    Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    src_file = objFSO.GetAbsolutePathName(Wscript.Arguments.Item(0))
    dest_file = objFSO.GetAbsolutePathName(WScript.Arguments.Item(1))
    
    Dim oExcel
    Set oExcel = CreateObject("Excel.Application")
    
    oExcel.DisplayAlerts = False
    
    Dim oBook
    Set oBook = oExcel.Workbooks.Open(src_file)
    
    oBook.Worksheets(5).Activate
    
    oBook.SaveAs dest_file, format
    
    oExcel.AutomationSecurity = lSecurity
    
    oBook.Close False
    oExcel.DisplayAlerts = True
    oExcel.Quit
Now I can't open protected excel files with this script, but if the excel files are unprotected it converts them much more quickly than the previous script. The same 4 excel files that are now not in protected view take an average 14 seconds to convert into csv files. I have ran this many times to make sure and I get the same result every time.

Why does checking for protected view cause the script to take much longer? Are there any ways to make it run faster? Also, are there any other alternatives to converting Excel files to CSV through command line? I also tried Powershell and it was even faster than VBScript! but I couldn't get it to work for protected view files. I should mention that I am running these scripts through QProcess in Qt 5.6. Thanks for any help
