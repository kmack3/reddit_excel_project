I want to merge several excel files into one big list, and cannot figure out how to do so.

I have Excel 2016, and am a beginner with Excel.  To preface, I have googled how to do this, but cannot understand the instructions given for these "macros".  I would be open to working with them, but I would require very exact, very thorough instruction.

Basically, I'm trying to merge some some voter records together, about 4000-5000 people's worth, separated into about 70-80 different excel files.  I want all of them on a single file, in a single list.  

Thank you to anyone who can help me with this problem.

Ron de Bruin has a bunch of sample code for merging data from different workbooks here:

If you're new to macros, you may want to read Debra Dalgleish's intro at: http://www.contextures.com/excelvbagettingstarted.html 

Good luck.

See this video on how to do it. As you have Excel 2016 Power Query was renamed Get and Transform and is under the Data tab in the ribbon.

Use Power Query! It's pretty intuitive. This youtube vid should get you most of the way there.

I'm stuck on "Consolidation Reference is not valid" whenever I try to add the reference.
