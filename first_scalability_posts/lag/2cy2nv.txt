New OSX Excel User. Help with lag.

My god it's horrible on OSX. I didn't think the difference would be that big. How are you OSX user's dealing with this? Everything is laggy and this shouldn't be the case. I'm using a brand new MBP. 

I'm thinking of either doing Bootcamp or Parallels just for Windows. Thoughts on what the most efficient method is?


-------------
I'm on mobile so I'm not going to dig up the link that lists the differences but don't waste your time with office for Mac. Do as you suggested to yourself and use parallels or bootcamp and run office 2013 on windows. Excel is much better on windows (even 2010 windows vs 2011 Mac)

edit: found the link http://blogs.parallels.com/enterprise-blog/2012/6/25/excel-for-mac-vs-pc-whats-the-difference.html less plugin support and less powerful pivot tables are some of the big things. especially if this is for a B-school student or a buisiness person (or a person who likes using pivot tables a lot)

Might just be your system, I have Office ~~2010~~ 2011 for Mac and it runs just fine. What're trying to do? (the fact the shortcuts are different though really sucks.)
-------------
Using Excel 2011 and I'm working with spreadsheets with 20k+ cells.

Navigating through the cells lag. Filtering lags. Copying and pasting lags. Overall, it's not a good experience and it bogs down my productivity 
-------------
Yeah I was mistaken I have 2011... but that being said, 20k cells may is a decent sized file. Does it run normally on windows?
-------------
Yep. Runs perfectly smooth on my older 7 year old laptop (Core 2 Duo days).
