Time Efficient Methods of Organizing and Sorting a Very Long Database?

I am assisting a colleague in organizing a spreadsheet containing information on the career paths of 18,000+ graduates from a University. This spreadsheet lists the first and last names, ID #, major, and subsequent organization and position title in their area of employment. I need to be able to easily filter by job title, however, the raw data was compiled in such a way that every individual could enter their own idiosyncratic position title in whatever wording they chose. As a result, there are hundreds upon hundreds of individual position titles (some of which are similar to one another). 

My first thought was to merge and reassign similar sounding position titles into a more concise list of broad titles. I thought of doing this by using a large number of conditional IF functions that flag someone with a predetermined position title if a certain string of text appears in the position title they entered. However, with 18,000+ entries, even this approach would be immensely time consuming and very manually intensive. 

This considered, I was wondering if anyone here had any ideas as to a more time efficient means of organizing the values in this spreadsheet?




-------------
I would approach it like this:

* copy the column containing the job titles to a separate sheet/book
* Data->Remove Duplicates to reduce it to unique values
* Add a second column called "Standardized Job Title"
* Fill in the second column with whatever your "cleaned" job title would be for the user-input job title.
* Add a new column to your existing sheet that does a simple vlookup from the original job title to get the standardized title.
