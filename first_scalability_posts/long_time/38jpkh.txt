Converting text formatted date/time to long date (includes day of week, military hours, and time zone)

Hey all,
I have a problem where I need to convert this information "Mon May 11, 2015 19:04:00 CDT" from text format to a usable short date format within excel.  It's for a monthly report and we're using a new inflexible system for our raw data source, so can't really change it before excel.  Attempted utilizing datevalue function as well as making adjustments via the data import wizard within excel but no dice.

Can redditors help please?  :)

Thanks!

Is the month always 3 letters?  If so, this worked for me.

=DATEVALUE(MID(F6,4,13))

If month isn't always 3 letters, but time is always 13 characters, you could do this - 

=DATEVALUE(MID(F6,4,LEN(F6)-17)

Is the Weekday abbreviation always 3 letters?  And in is Military time always 6 numbers? (XX;XX;XX)??

If so, then the following seems to work perfectly:
=DATEVALUE(MID(A2,5,FIND(":",A2)-8))

The Mid Statement starts at the 5th character in(which in your example is the M in May), and then searches for the first Colon in the military time uses that count position minus 8 to determine how many characters to grab...in this version it doesn't matter if the data is a short date or a long date.

=DATEVALUE(MID(E2,4,13))

The first thing you listed took care of it for me, thanks soo much Mr. Narrator 

=DATEVALUE(MID(E2,4,13))

Was able to resolve it by going with "=DATEVALUE(MID(E2,4,13))".  To answer your question it was always in 3 letters for weekday and military time was always in that format.  Thanks for your help Chrome!
