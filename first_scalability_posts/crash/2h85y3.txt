VBA Code Causes Crash, Not doing anything crazy.

So This VBA code is in a few of our spreadsheets, it works perfectly fine for one of our users, but for a few other of our users it results in outright excel crashes approximately 80% of the time. Any thoughts on what is going on?

All this code does, is duplicate a tab, then save it with the current date in a folder.

    Sub saveAcme()
    Dim wb As Workbook
    Sheets("Summary").Calculate
    Worksheets("Summary").Select
    Worksheets("Summary").Copy
    Set wb = ActiveWorkbook
    ActiveSheet.Cells.Select
    Selection.Copy
    Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlValues, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks:= _
            False, Transpose:=False
    wb.SaveAs "O:\Sales\Users\mike\CLIENTS\acmeSummary\acme (" + Application.WorksheetFunction.Text(Now, "mm-dd-yy") + ").xls"
    wb.Close
    Application.CutCopyMode = False
    End Sub    

Thanks

Users\mike?

Is the second persons name 'mike' as well?  Is that a shared directory?

Without testing the only thing that looks off is this line:

     wb.SaveAs "O:\Sales\Users\mike\CLIENTS\acmeSummary\acme (" + Application.WorksheetFunction.Text(Now, "mm-dd-yy") + ").xls"

Should be:

     wb.SaveAs "O:\Sales\Users\mike\CLIENTS\acmeSummary\acme\ (" + Application.WorksheetFunction.Text(Now, "mm-dd-yy") + ").xls"

Currently on mobile, so I will run though some tests a bit later if that does not fix it...

When you say "crashing", what do you mean exactly?  Is there an error message, or does it just freeze?

    wb.SaveAs "O:\Sales\Users\mike\CLIENTS\acmeSummary\acme (" + Application.WorksheetFunction.Text(Now, "mm-dd-yy") + ").xls"

Should really be:

    wb.SaveAs "O:\Sales\Users\mike\CLIENTS\acmeSummary\acme\ (" & Format(Date, "mm-dd-yyyy") & ").xls"

Not sure why you are using brackets in a file name? Also, you should always avoid using .Select.
-------------
Try running the macro line by line by pressing F8 so that you could narrow down to the line causing trouble. 
-------------
its a shared directory.

everyone has same permissions, to the directory.
-------------
well the file we want to be saved is "acme (09-22-14).xls"
-------------
Crashing is as follows:

Freezes and then has Excel has quit unexpectedly, and gives you option to recover.


-------------
Ah okay, sorry about that... 
-------------
If you step thought (F8) at what point does it crash?
-------------
Sorry I realize i should have included that, it's crashing at the wb.close call, and when it doesn't crash it will sometimes throw up the pop-up "Excel cannot complete the task with available resources" warning or a message close to that.

That means you are running out of memory.

How big is the data you are copying?  Do you really have to copy EVERY CELL? That's 1048576 rows X 16384 columns (17,179,869,184 cells).

I don't I'll try copying a range, creating a new workbook and going that route.

Doing the operation by hand works fine its only when automating it that it encounters issues.

> Sheets("Summary").Calculate

How many formulas do you have and how complex are they?  Why are you calculating?
-------------
The summary sheet is basically a bunch of VLOOKUPs into the rest of the tabs.

I'm calculating since we keep our sheets on manual calculation. But as noted elsewhere the error crops up during the wb.close command.
-------------
Not much I can suggest other than checkout the Microsoft link.  The error your getting means you are running out of memory.

Changing it to copying a large range A1:BZ2000 fixed the issue. Thanks for the suggestions.
