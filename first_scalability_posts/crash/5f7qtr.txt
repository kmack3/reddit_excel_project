VBA Code only crashes when used on a Mac


**EDIT ** : Ok, so by googling the error message, it seems that the problem is when trying to assign the combo-box value, by using Combobox.value = "value" . It seems it's better to assign it by using ComboBox.listindex = IntegerValue.


Yeah, I know, Excel for macs. What can I say, the people I built something for have some employees use their Macs.

I'm reaching out to the community as a last attempt before I tell my client that it'd be more cost effective for him to buy a second hand laptop for his employee who processes order than it is for him to pay me to debug this. But maybe you guys have encountered this before.

It's a simple code to call a userform to show. The code fails on Userform.Show. Which normally means that it's something in the Initialize trigger of the code that fails.

I encountered the situation that if a userform textbox is locked, Excel for Mac won't let your code put something in it, while Excel for PC doesn't care. I solved this one by putting a ".locked = false" call before inserting value and a ".locked = true" call after.

But it's not doing it. Here's the code 

        Sub ModReservationClick()
    
    If Selection.Rows.Count > 1 Or Selection.Columns.Count > 1 Then
        MsgBox "Select only 1 cell", , "Selection error"
        Exit Sub
    Else
        RowReservPub = ActiveCell.Row
        
        If ReservationsWS.Range("A" & RowReservPub).Value <> "" And RowReservPub <> 1 Then
            
            ModReservationForm.Show
        Else
            MsgBox "Veuillez choisir une rŽservation en cliquant n'importe o " & Chr(10) & _
            "sur une ligne de rŽservation ci-bas", , "SŽlectionner une rŽservation"
        End If
    End If
    End Sub


End then for the Initializing of the form

    Private Sub UserForm_Initialize()
    
    Dim ItemNo As String
    Dim DispoQte As Long
    Dim ReservedQte As Long
    
    RepBox.List = Application.WorksheetFunction.Transpose(Ranges.Range("Reps"))
    ClientBox.List = Application.WorksheetFunction.Transpose(ClientsWS.Range("ClientsList"))
    
    
    
    RepBox.Value = ReservationsWS.Range("E" & RowReservPub).Value2
    ClientBox.Value = ReservationsWS.Range("A" & RowReservPub).Value2
    NoteBox.Value = ReservationsWS.Range("F" & RowReservPub).Value2
    
    QteBox.Locked = False
    ProduitBox.Locked = False
    
    QteBox.Value = ReservationsWS.Range("C" & RowReservPub).Value2
    ItemNo = Right(ReservationsWS.Range("K" & RowReservPub).Value2, NoCharItem)
    ProduitBox.Value = Application.WorksheetFunction.VLookup(ItemNo, ItemsWS.Range("ItemsData"), 4, 0)
    Datebox.Value = Format(ReservationsWS.Range("D" & RowReservPub).Value2, "yyyy-mm-dd")
    
    DispoBox.Locked = False
    ReserveBox.Locked = False
    
    
    DispoBox.Value = Application.WorksheetFunction.SumIf(ItemsWS.Range("ItemsNo"), ReservationsWS.Range("B" & RowReservPub).Value2, ItemsWS.Range("ItemsDispo"))
    ReserveBox.Value = Application.WorksheetFunction.SumIf(ReservationsWS.Range("ReservedItems"), ReservationsWS.Range("B" & RowReservPub).Value2, ReservationsWS.Range("ReservedQte"))
    
    QteBox.Locked = True
    ProduitBox.Locked = True
    
    DispoBox.Locked = True
    ReserveBox.Locked = True
    
    End Sub

Check UTF-8, charsets, all that stuff. I see you are using special characters, sometimes shit happens with that
-------------
What error is it giving you? As far as I know, Excel for Mac does not support activex. Could that be the issue?
-------------
Looks like you haven't defined all of your objects explicitly, you may want to spend 5 minutes and try that. My thought is Mac may be more "fussy" when it comes to variable types. 
-------------
Error has only been described to me. I don't have a Mac.

Going off memory, it went something along the line of "Could no show property value" ...
-------------
Thank you for your input!

I see what you mean, though the variables that appear to be undefined are actually public variables (RowReservPub) or public constants (NoCharItem) that are explicitly defined somewhere else. And all my worksheets are referred to by their index name.

Anyways, my client will meet me today at lunch with his Mac and we'll see what we can do.

Gotcha, good luck.
