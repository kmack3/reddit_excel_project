Simple VBA Crashes Excel in Mac

Copying a row is an action I do a lot so I decided to create a keyboard shortcut. Unfortunately, about 80% of the time I use it, excel crashes on my mac. I'm running Microsoft Excel for Mac 15.34 on a Macbook Pro running Sierra 10.12.5. This doesn't happen with the other macros I've written, so my guess is there is something faulty in the code. Any insight into why this might be happening is greatly appreciated.

Sub CopyRow()
'
' CopyRow Macro
'
' Keyboard Shortcut: Option+Cmd+b
'
    Dim SRow As Integer
    Dim SCol As Integer
    SRow = ActiveCell.Row
    SCol = ActiveCell.Column
    Rows(ActiveCell.Row).Copy
    Rows(ActiveCell.Row).Insert Shift:=xlDown
    Cells(SRow, SCol).Select
End Sub


-------------
If you run this below row 32767, you should get a runtime error due to using Integer rather than Long for SRow.

Maybe Excel for Mac handles the VBA differently, but under Windows you could just use

    Sub CopyRow2()
      With ActiveCell.EntireRow
        .Copy
        .Insert Shift:=xlDown
      End With
      Application.CutCopyMode = False
    End Sub

Alternatively, it may be a recalculation problem following the insert operation. If the macro above still has problems, try the following.

    Sub CopyRow3()
      With Application
        .ScreenUpdating = False
        .Calculation = xlCalculationManual
      End With
      With ActiveCell.EntireRow
        .Copy
        .Insert Shift:=xlDown
      End With
      With Application
        .CutCopyMode = False
        .Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
      End With
    End Sub
-------------
        Dim Rng as range: set rng=selection

    With Rng 
        .copy
        Selection.entirerow.insert shift:=xldown
    End with

Thanks. I tried the first one. hasn't crashed on me yet...
