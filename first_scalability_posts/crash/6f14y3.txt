Excel crashes when opening macro-enabled files.

Does anyone have a good solution for Excel crashing when opening macro enabled (XLSM) files only? This issue started 2 days ago (6/1). It started completely out-of-the-blue, and I have not made any changes to my system recently. There was a Windows update that installed on 5/31, but the problem persists even after I uninstall that update.


The top solutions through a Google search have not resolved the issue. I’m posting here to see if anyone has previously encountered this and has a solution.


Here’s what I know:

-	System: Windows 10, up-to-date (KB3150513 on 5/31); Excel 2016 through 365 subscription, up-to-date.

-	Issue began on 6/1.

-	Most xlsm files will crash (Message: Microsoft Excel has stopped working). Most times, it will crash right after attempting to load the file. Occasionally, it will open the file but will crash.

-	Some very basic xlsm files will work. Not 100% confident on this, but it seems like only files with Worksheet events or more than 1 module will crash.

-	I’ve tested impacted files on my work computer and they work fine. Same version of Excel, but uses Windows 10 Enterprise Edition. This means that it's an issue with my Excel/Windows 10 settings, but I haven't changed any settings in months.

-	The above points indicate that my files are not corrupted.

-	My VBA is solid and only includes the default libraries.

-	I have not made any significant changes to my system recently (I use it mostly for Excel). I haven’t accessed any dodgy websites or made any program downloads or installs. Virus and malware scans check out.
Here’s what I’ve attempted so far:

-	Guidance provided by Microsoft did not resolve the issue. Deactivated and uninstalled all add-ins, did a repair, changed default printer, and even did a manual uninstall/install.

-	Various non-Microsoft solutions did not resolve the issue, including deactivating VBA on demand compile, changing document trust settings, temporarily saving as xlsx, etc.

-	Uninstalled all programs that interact with Excel (Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio Tools for Office)

-	Confirmed that add-in junk was removed from registry.

-	Uninstalled the 5/31 Windows Update.

Here are my current work-arounds.

-	As of yesterday, I could open impacted files with a 50% success rate if I opened it through excel while a xlsx file was open. This no longer works today.

-	As of today, I can open impacted files (3 attempts, all successful) if I opened it through Excel with a very basic xlsm file running (permits macros to be activated when the basic file is opened).


These work-arounds are not ideal and do not seem to be stable, so any advice on long-term fixes would be welcome. May try a full system restore later today. Will post updated if I figure out a fix on my own.



-------------
If you're still grasping for straws, try getting rid of all ActiveX (if any) components in one of your files.  I think they are evil... deleting them has brought some of my dead files back to life. 

Also, have you tried deleting *.exd from your system?
