Excel crash issue after adding column

Hello,


Was wondering if any of you have by chance an answer for this one.


I have a file with calculations both left and right of column N. The columns on the right of column N are hidden and column N and left of that are visible/designed.


I need to insert one more column to the visible/designed side of my sheet. When I do that, and save it, the whole sheet still works. But the next time I open it, it will crash excel once I try to do anything on the sheet. I am able to press ALT F11 to access my macros, but it does give me an error upon opening and if I try to alter anything:  > compile error: error in loading dll


Anyone got any idea what causes it? The file works perfectly without that added column.


Edit: also tried moving all columns right of column N one column to the right. Gives me the same problems.

* What version of Excel are you using?
* What file format are you using?
* Are you using third-party add-ins?
* What do the macros do?
* Go to: VBA Editor > Tools > References and tell us what reference the workbook is loading.
* Go to: File > Options > Add-Ins and tell us what add-ins Excel is loading.

Reading your post I am opening up the file again to answer your questions. It didn't crash... Not sure why. I had it crashing on me on 3 different business computers. My personal computer handles it just fine...

Sorry to waste your time. I will report back monday when I get to test it out on a work computer again.


Edit: If you want I could send it to you, maybe check if it crashes at your computer?

No thanks.

Hey!

Wanted to report back. It didn't crash at work either anymore. So to clean the file a bit before implementing it, I resized a column a bit to fit the text better. Aaand it crashed because of that.

Very strange. Not sure what to think anymore. I think the file is just corrupted or something. I'll just make changes to columns at my home computer, as it does not crash at my own computer.

So, I reread your post, and do you mean that you've set as hidden *all* columns to the right of N?
