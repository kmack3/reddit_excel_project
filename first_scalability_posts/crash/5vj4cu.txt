Macro to show value as a calculation in a Pivot Table using VBA. My doesn't work and crashes Excel when it errors.

In cell J25, I have made it so that a date can written and the pivot table will show the value field as the difference from this date. However, my code errors at:

    .BaseItem = CLng(dfrom)

In fact, Excel doesn't like it so much that it crashes when I run the macro. I'll admit that this is the first time I've tried anything adventurous with a PivotTable in VB so I was expecting the code to not work the first time round but I can't see anything that could cause Excel to crash.

Here's the entire macro:

    Sub difffrom()
    
    dfrom = Sheets("Projection").Range("J25").value
    
        With Sheets("Tracking").PivotTables("Net Worth Tracker").PivotFields( _
            "Sum of Capital Gain")
            .Calculation = xlDifferenceFrom
            .BaseItem = CLng(dfrom)
            .NumberFormat = "Â£#,##0.00"
        End With
    
    End If
    
    End Sub

Are you storing a date within cell `J25`? If you are, and you're trying to figure out the number of days from the date given in `J25` you would need to use this:

    DateDiff("d", Range("J25").Value, Now())

This would return the number of days between the date stored in cell `J25` and today's date.

I want to show the value field in my pivot table as the difference from the value at date J25. Working out the datedif won't do anything to solve the problem.
