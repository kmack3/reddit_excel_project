crash

Excel crashes when entering a custom function either as a formula in a cell or in the Immediate window. Solutions I found online don't help.

**There is nothing in my XLSTART folders, and I have no add-ins. The crash still happens in safe mode (started Excel while holding Ctrl).**

##Background

`Option Explicit` is enabled.

I have this function definition in Module1:

    Function angularPos(object As String, time As Variant)
    ' calculate the angular position of the object at the given time
        Dim rate As Variant
        rate = CDec(objectRate(object))
        angularPos = Modulo((rate * time), 1)
    End Function

The `Modulo()` function is this (defined because VBA's Mod function returns only integers):

    Function Modulo(a, b)
    ' non-rounding modulo function
        Modulo = a - (b * (a \ b))
        If Modulo < 0 Then
            Modulo = 1 + Modulo
        End If
    End Function

The `objectRate()` function just returns a dummy value for now (currently `1 As Decimal`).

##Problem

*All of the functions used to work fine in the VBA editor's Immediate window.*

However, when I tried to type `=angularPos(…)` into a cell, Excel crashed as soon as I got to the open parenthesis. Now it crashes if I try to run any of the functions either in the sheet or in the Immediate window.

##Looking for a solution

I did a Google search for `excel crashes when entering function` and found suggestions to disable add-ins, remove files from all XLSTART folders, and start in safe mode. As I noted at the top, none of these suggestions helped. There were no good results for a search for `excel crashes when entering custom function`, and none of the results for the first search mentioned custom functions. Also, built-in functions like `SUM()` still work fine.

Any ideas what's wrong? Did I somehow accidentally introduce a fatal error between trying it in the Immediate window and trying it in the sheet?


-------------
Instead of running the code as a function, try converting it to a subroutine first, then run it like that. Make sure you step into it as well so you can see what's causing it to crash, if anything.

I tried that a minute ago and got compile errors when trying to run it as a Sub, either "Expected: =" or "Expected function or variable" depending on whether I typed just `angularPos(…)` or `x = angularPos(…)` (with x declared as a Variant) in the Immediate window. At least it doesn't crash, though.

Then I changed it back to a Function and it works perfectly again. It also works in a cell. Very strange. I'll mark it solved, but I might be back later if it breaks again. Thanks for the mysteriously effective help. :)

Uh, yeah… I did change it to "solved" already, but I guess it didn't stick. Thanks for catching that for me.
