Excel crashes when selecting "Macros" in Ribbon customization screen.

So, if Excel (2010) has been open for more than 15 seconds, and I try to customize the Ribbon bar by adding some of my macros as buttons, whenever I select 'Macros' from the "Choose Commands From:" drop-down menu, Excel will crash.     I can then re-open Excel and get it to work as long as I don't do anything else with Excel beforehand.  *It has to be a very freshly opened Excel version for it not to crash when I select "Macros".*

Anyone seen this before?   Any fixes known?

Thanks,

I'd reinstall it.
