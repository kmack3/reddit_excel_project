'Big data' manipulation

Some background: so I consider myself an OK Excel user. I'm a financial analyst who works on a lot of Excel-based financial modelling projects, although the spectrum of Excel ability is broad and I know there is a huge amount I don't know.  
    

Anyway, I have been invited to interview with a financial services 'startup' (specifically, it's a peer-to-peer lending company) for an analyst/modelling position. The job posting specified that experience in SQL/Tableau would be helpful but they are aware that I have limited experience in these areas.  
  
So with that introduction out of the way, I have been informed I will be required to undertake a 'big data manipulation' exercise in Excel as part of the interview. Google hasn't been helpful in terms of precedents, so now I come to the wise heads of r/excel seeking guidance.

Has anyone encountered something similar? Have you come across any guides/introductions to 'big data' manipulation in Excel?

Agree with u/pancak3d in that it's probably not that big, but that's just a matter of opinion (I talked to a colleague about 1 billion records last week and she laughed at the idea that was 'big data').

Regardless, I'd look into the Power Pivot tools. Make sure you can use the Data Model and maybe get a few basic DAX formulas under your belt (like RELATED and CALCULATE), or learn how to create Measures and KPI's. There's lots of videos on YouTube for that.

Honestly, data manipulation in excel without Power Query / Power Pivot is just excel. If that's what their talking then SUMIFS and INDEX MATCH are about as good as it gets.

They probably aren't truly big data if they're in Excel. I'd imagine the need for pivot tables, lookups, summarizing formulas, etc. to condense large data sets into more meaningful information.

Flair changed to discussion.

Thanks u/rnelsonee, these are features I hadn't considered and I will definitely take a look at over the next few days. Really appreciate you taking the time to comment.

Thanks u/pancak3d, I imagine you are right in this case.

Thanks. Apologies if I haven't set up the thread correctly - it's my first post here.
