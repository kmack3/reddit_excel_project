Vertical sheet too big in file size after transpose

Hi,

I have this sheet where I put my weight and circumferences of my body. It also makes graphs out of the data. The file has seven different sheets, one for data and six different graph sheets.
The sheet used to be horizontal like this [picture](http://imgur.com/AtiuZmv). 
File size was very nice 59,0kb.

Yesterday I thought to make it horizontal. I copied the sheet under the original sheet, used transpose and moved the new, transposed sheet to start from A1. I also added some borders to the sheet and froze the first row. I had to do all the graph sheets again, so I did that. 
Now the sheet looks like this [picture](http://imgur.com/wYUKIDd).
And whaaat, over 6Mb?!
After the transpose the file started to work really slow. My i5-6600K struggled to get the sheet work.
I have used 6001 rows in the sheet. That means 16 years. But, the file was heavy before I added all these years. I deleted all the formatting from 6002 - *end of sheet* to make it work smoother, but this had little effect.

So, what to do? I feel like it isn't right that it takes 5 seconds to change from a sheet to another, as it happened instantly before the transpose. Why is vertical sheet so much bigger in file size and harder to process?
Of course I have the old version saved, I can use it, but I'd just want to know why this happened. Have I done something wrong?

Thanks for your help!

Copy the data to a new sheet, do not format...  just use the data for your graphs.. save as .xlsb

metadata accrues in the spreadsheet file as you edit and redo and undo.. so start with a clean spreadshee.t xlsb is binary format the saves smaller also.

There must somehow been a **LOT** of metadata. Thanks, this helped, without all the fancy formatting the file size is now 430kb, and the file now works smoothly.
