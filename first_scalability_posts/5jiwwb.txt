Convert big hexa number (more than 10 carracter) into decimal

I have a verry big csv file with a collumn I need converted from hexadecimal do decimal, all hexa numbers are the same size but it's too long for the HEXDEC fonction.
Is there another way to convert it?
Here's a example :
0x26F8BC62048F3097F35241BEA984B476

You'll need to split it into pieces and do each part separately then convert and add to a result.

Can you explain this formula? I'm not very used to excel, what are the arguments after the cell (C8) and why is he using the POWER?
    = HEX2DEC(RIGHT(C8,10))+HEX2DEC(MID(C8,3,5))*POWER(16,10)
-------------
That's not going to work - because you have a 32 digit HEX number so you need to split it into 4 pieces, anyway...because HEX2DEC has an upper limit of a 10 digit hex number.

The power is to calculate the shifted part (digits 11,12,13,14,15) value in decimal.

Look at this sheet I made.

Although it *appears* to lose least significant values...

Yeah, I know, I wanted to adapt it but I don't get how it works excatly.
I belive that "HEX2DEC(RIGHT(C8,10))" convert the first 10 digit but i dont get the "C8,3,5" in "HEX2DEC(MID(C8,3,5))" and how can I dapt it to use the rest of the number?

SOLUTION VERIFIED!

This worked, thank you!
Just one last thing, excel display result like these "1,23486E+38" insted of "123485684420329000000000000000000000000" no mater what I do.
I need the full version so i can remove the 0 behind whith "=STXT(G4;1;15)", I can display it but the STXT fonction still return "1,23485684420329"
Any ideas?

See my other message - I made it to show you. It seems to indicate numeric overflow, however.

Change format from General to Number...

Convert to text =TEXT(A1,"0")

I seems like I can use your solution, has I understand it (although I might be wrong) you convert two hex in dec then subtract then and then re-convert them in hex.
I just have a very large number tha I need converted in dec.
For clarification, thoses a phones numbers converted in hex to be stored in a sql database (I work from the extact of tha database).
But before the dec to hex conversion something add a bunch of 0 after the phone number supposely to make it fill the max digit number of the field, with is I now have to deal with insanely great numbers and complicated excel stuff.

Edit: My bad, I didn't see the right message, I'll look at your sheet.
