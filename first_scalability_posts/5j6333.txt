Transpose individual rows from different tables and insert into one big table

I'm a complete beginner and I'm prettyyy sure I messed up some terms in the title. I'm sorry! But basically [this is what I want](http://imgur.com/a/JzPn9)

I can't show you the exact data but basically, I have 5 tables representing 5 different brainwave frequencies. In each of those 5 tables I have 16 columns (for 16 different locations of scalp electrodes)
The readings taken are for the same 40 subjects in each table. 

I've been tasked to come up with one huge table where all 16*5 readings for each subject is in one column. After the first subject, I move on to the 2nd subject's readings and so on.

What I did was insert 80 rows in between each subject number and then manually cut and pasted the values. This is time-consuming and my hands hurt so much :(

Is there a faster way to do this? I looked online but I think I'm using the wrong terms because I can't seem to get a proper result. Please bear in mind I have no experience in VBA.

So you want to "unpivot" the data.  [This is the way to do it in 2010-2013](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Unpivot-columns-Power-Query-0f7bad4b-9ea1-49c1-9d95-f588221c7098) although it may involve a (free Microsoft supplied) add-in.  Note for that method you can create a column called Category for each table, and fill that in (all 1's for one table, all 2's for the other, etc). Then copy all tables so their adjacent to one another.

There's also [this way](http://superuser.com/questions/78439/is-it-possible-to-unpivot-or-reverse-pivot-in-excel). For that, you need to keep you format as is (no Category column), and then you'll have to add the Category column after the unpivot. I think with this you don't need to make all the tables adjacent, just add multiple sources. But if that doesn't work, just do a copy and paste to make them all one table first.

Yes, UNPIVOT is the word! I will try this out and update accordingly. Thanks!

Update: It worked! Thanks! :D
