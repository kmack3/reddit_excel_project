Top row of data being sorted even though Freeze Panes is active

Excel 2010. 

First row is column information, so I've frozen the panes for that row. Now I need to sort the remaining information ascending/descending, but it's sorting the top row as well, moving my column headers around.

I'm sure I've done this before. Any advice?

Thanks

When you click the sort button from the 'Data' ribbon, you will see an un-ticked box at the top right hand corner that says [] My data has headers

Tick that and you should be good to go

Yeah, freezing the window panes has nothing to do with telling Sort to ignore or pay attention to a header row.
