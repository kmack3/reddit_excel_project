Is there a way to freeze rows from the bottom on google spreadsheets? 1000th and 999th rows)

I already have the first 3 rows frozen in a google spreadsheet now want to freeze the 1000th and 999th rows so that I can see rows 1,2,3,999,1000 at all times no matter where Im at on the spreadsheet. Is there a way to do this?

Thanks!

As far as I know, you need to open comparison windows.
