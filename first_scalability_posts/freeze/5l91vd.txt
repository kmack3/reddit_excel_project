How to freeze 2 column, 16 row table and nothing else?

Hi guys, so as the title states I'm trying to freeze the first 2 columns and only the 16 rows of those 2 columns (and also the first row in its entirety if possible in conjunction) and nothing else so that when I scroll down the main spreadsheet I can always see that 2x16 table on the left.

Is this possible at all and if so how?

I've managed to freeze it for horizontal scrolling easily but I can't figure out how to do it for vertical too.

Thanks!

Click on the cell at the outside bottom intersection of your 2x16 cell group and select Free Panes

You can't freeze something in place and have everything else around it move.

You can only lock rows/columns above and to the left.

If you're willing to use a complex and fragile event handler, your _frozen_ area could be a picture link, and you could use the SelectionChange event handler to keep it in the upper-left of the worksheet window as you move around in the worksheet.

Thanks for the reply. Unfortunately when I do that it freezes all of the rows above that cell and not just the 2 columns.

You can have a floating window! sort of!

1.  Highlight the rows and take a camera snapshot.
2.  Paste the snapshot on the page.
3.  Click on the snapshot and in the cell reference field change the name to PictureX
4.  Open VBA (alt+F11) and past the following code in the worksheet module for that worksheet. The code re-positions the image to the top corner on a cell click.

.


    Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
     If Target.Cells.Count > 1 Then Exit Sub
     With ActiveWindow.VisibleRange
     ActiveSheet.Shapes("PictureX").Top = .Top
     ActiveSheet.Shapes("PictureX").Left = .Left
     End With
     End Sub

Might be able to get away with the split screen bars here as well. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=15Oejw3CLuc

There is also the  [Watch Window](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Watch-a-formula-and-its-result-by-using-the-Watch-Window-d72fc6f3-4c9d-4c13-bd15-bb074ba7c784) to monitor cell values in real time. TIL :)

[Video example also here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbLZW_vQ-yA)

You can have the watch window floating or drag it onto the menu bar.

Picky: OP wants the top row to be a frozen pane, so the .Top property would need to be modified.

That will not work with this workaround..

If the shape is placed at the top top row all its contents are hidden where the scroll occurs past the 1st row as you scroll.

Though [you seem confident](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5l91vd/how_to_freeze_2_column_16_row_table_and_nothing/dbv2azh/) so curious to see your solution  :) ... I am just a hacker!!!

I'm not using a Windows machine today, so can't confirm today.

Maybe necessary to use picture links for both top row (which would need to adjust for different columns in view) and 2-column table on left side.
