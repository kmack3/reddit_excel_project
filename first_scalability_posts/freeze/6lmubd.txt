freeze

File type that will remove formulas or "freeze" all data in worksheet.

Basically looking for a way to "Save as" my file as a certain file type that would allow me to execute this procedure. Any other advice as to how I may be able to accomplish this would be greatly appreciated!


-------------
You can copy the original worksheet, open a new workbook, then do a PasteSpecial Values and PasteSpecial Formulas.

That's the manual method, this can also be automated in VBA.
-------------
Sub Protectall ()

dim ws as Worksheet

Dim pwd As String

Pwd ="type your password here"

For Each ws In Worksheets

          ws.Protect Password:=pwd

Next ws

End Sub

Thank you! Just to be sure, is there not a certain file I can save my worksheet as so that this process is done automatically?


-------------
You can try saving as a .CSV but you'll lose any formatting. CSVs are also limited to a single worksheet.
