Freeze Pane for a group of Cells? Not top row or column

So I have some data from Cells V4:W7. I want this group of cells to follow me down the page as a scroll. Is this possible? I already have freeze panes for my top two rows.

Two options:

1.  Watch Window.  Formulas tab, third button from the right.  Click "add watch" and it will show those eight cells *as a list* in a window that's always on top.
2.  Open a new window.  View tab, click "new window" (in the middle), then "arrange all" (next to "new window").  You can keep one window focused on those cells, and the other as your main work window.
