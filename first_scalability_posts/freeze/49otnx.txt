Way to freeze a row WITHOUT freezing rows above it?

Is there a way to "Freeze" a row and not freeze any of the rows above it?

Edit: Sorry, error in phrasing the question. Let's say there's header info in rows 1-5. When the user scroll, I'd like the scroll to behave normally UNTIL row 5 reaches the top of the window, at which point row 5 become froven at the top.

Nope, sorry.

You can split the screen but it won't achieve what you want.

The closest you can come is [splitting the screen](http://m.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-split-a-worksheet-into-windows-in-excel-201.html)

There's something called a watch window, which displays the result of cells you specify. This could be a route around your problem?

You _might_ be able to accomplish this with VBA script and changing the frozen pane as the page scrolls, but there isn't a way to "sticky" a header...
