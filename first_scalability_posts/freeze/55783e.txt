Freeze =countif after the month

Lets say i have a list from a1-a10 of 10 customers. They are all bound to pay $100 each month. And on b1-b10 i put an x when the customer has paid.
Then i have underneath a percentage, all of this is working and when all of them have paid i get 100% but next month i get two new customers a11 and a12, ofc they have not paid for last month but when i add them to the list the percentage for last month drops down.
Is there any way to freeze the countif when it has passed specific date or something?

Sorry for bad English

Have a look at COUNTIFS where you can have miltiple criteria, so you could include the date.

This is the correct solution, instead of writing an X, write the date when the customer pays you.

It looks like you tried to award a ClippyPoint, but you need to reply to a particular user's comment to do so, rather than making a new top-level comment.

Please reply directly to any helpful users and Clippy, our bot, will take it from there. If your intention was not to award a ClippyPoint and simply mark the post as solved, then you may do that by clicking Set Flair. Thank you!
