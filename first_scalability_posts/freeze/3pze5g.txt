[VBA] Automatic Goal Seek freezes Excel

I'm using a pretty simple code below to automatically goal seek whenever a value is changed anywhere on the worksheet:

    Sub Worksheet_Calculate()
       Range("K34").GoalSeek Goal:=0, ChangingCell:=Range("C21")
    End Sub

The goal seek works and displays the correct value in cell C21, however it displays a run-time error "Method 'GoalSeek' of option 'Range' failed" and Excel freezes like it's stuck in an infinite loop.  I have to open task manager to kill it.

I can put the same code into a module and the macro works just fine, but I would prefer if it would work automatically in the sheet's code like it's supposed to.  Any thoughts?

Thank you!

What if you tried using one of the other event handlers in place of `Worksheet_Calculate`, like say `Worksheet_Change`?

It looks like I figured it out.

I noticed some people using Application.EnableEvents=False at the beginning of the code and Application.EnableEvents=True at the end.  I have no idea what this does, but it appears to have solved it.

Here's the final code:

    Sub Worksheet_Calculate()
        Application.EnableEvents = False
        Range("K34").GoalSeek Goal:=0, ChangingCell:=Range("C21")
        Application.EnableEvents = True
    End Sub

Using Worksheet_Change gives this error when I change a value:

*Compile error:*

*Procedure declaration does not match description of event or procedure having the same name.*
