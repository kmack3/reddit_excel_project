Would like to lock or freeze data in cell once it is populated

Good afternoon,

Our company sends out pricing to our customers via an excel document on a daily basis.  In order to capture this data for reference (such as yesterday's price), we save our price sheet as a PDF file.  

What I'm trying to do is export the pricing data from our Pricing Excel workbook into a Historical Pricing Excel workbook.  Through a lot of googling, I've figured out how to link the workbooks, and using an If statement, I've figured out how to populate the pricing in the Historical Pricing workbook.  However, in an attempt to automate this process as much as possible, I've used an If statement involving the date.  Essentially, all I have to do is open the Historical Pricing workbook, populate the date, and my desired pricing populates.  But when tomorrow rolls around, I'll go in and punch in tomorrow's date and lose all of today's data.

So my question is - is there a way to lock the data once it has populated and prevent it from disappearing when I change the date the next day?  Is there any sort of If statement that basically says "if data populates, freeze it forever and never, ever let it be changed"?

Select the data, press Ctrl+C to copy it, navigate to a blank sheet, and then type Alt+E+S (or right click and select Paste Special). Select "Values" to paste the hard-coded values.

Someone better at VBA could probably write a simple script to automate this whole process for you, but I'll leave that up to them.

Thanks for this - got me thinking a bit.  Is there a way to "bring over" hard coded values automatically?  My thinking along these lines would be - I can have the "If=Date(xxxx,x,xx)" statement create the data, then I could pull it into to a new worksheet as a hard coded value, which would actually work perfectly in my situation.  

I ran across a lot of VBA talk in my afternoon googling.  I haven't dug into that at all, but I'm trying to clean things up and make my job easier, so I hope to get into that in the near future.

Thanks for the reply!

Yes, you can easily write (or even 'record') a macro for doing this. It will look something like this:

    Sub CopyCol()
        Sheets("Sheet1").Columns("A").Copy
        Sheets("Sheet2").Columns("B").PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
    End Sub
