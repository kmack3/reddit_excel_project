How to freeze row in MS Excel like Google Spreadsheet does?




-------------
View --> Freeze panes.  Select a row or select a cell to tell it where to freeze.  

Also, I just wanted to let you know that your title bugs me.  Excel had the option first and google spreadsheet copied it...
-------------
Sometimes if you want to have the column and the row, it's easier to use split panes

if title is row 1, and more tiles column a, click b2 and hit split, right next to freeze panes

Does "xxx like yyy does" imply yyy did it first? I didn't mean it, perhaps my english is bad.

I had never used MS Excel before but OpenOffice and Google Doc. In this company I am forced to use MS Excel **STARTER**, which turns out doesn't even have freeze pane function, maybe I will just switch to OpenOffice before my boss buys me an MS Excel.

Is this thing saying -1 point awarded?
-------------
Nope, that's just how Clippy responds to mods who suggest that award points be distributed. A few people have asked that before, don't worry.
