Freeze Column B and Row 1 at the same time?

How do I freeze column B and my first row at the same time?


-------------
Click on cell C2 then click the Freeze button. (Not for first row or first column, just Freeze.) (I'm writing this without looking at Excel, so my wording may be slightly off.) 
-------------
Also, how do I freeze any column and any row at the same time?
-------------
Select the cell next to the intersection of the row & column you want to freeze. So to freeze column B and row 1 â€“ select the cell C2, Go to View>Freeze Panes
