Why do MS Office hyperlinks to "patents.google.com" host freeze up on second attempt? (x-post from /r/Software)

Any hyperlink created to the hose "patents.google.com" in any MS Office 2013 program will freeze up after the first attempt. It doesn't happen for any other common host url that I've tried. It happens in all browsers, and has been testing on more than one PC. Security settings have been disabled on the OS, browser, and software. I suspect there is a scripting error on the webpage side, leaving the link "open" after the first click, causing an interference with the second click. Another observation is that you can immediately break the freeze by hitting escape. Also, you can open several different pages on this domain quickly and without issue, until you repeat one.

Thanks for checking.   I tried it on my home computer and it worked fine.   I think it may be a network firewall setting that i don't have privelege to.
