How to freeze a number in a cell after a macro transfers the formula to a different sheet

Hi everyone,

I currently am working on a spreadsheet that uses a macro to transfer an entire row of data over to a different spreadsheet when the value in column I equals a certain value.

When rows are transferred to the other spreadsheet, I want the value in a certain cell to freeze. The problem is, that formula is reliant on the current date. Here is the formula:

=IF($G4="","",TODAY()-$G4)

Basically, the formula takes the date that is entered into column G, and converts it into a number based on the number of days since that date. The metric I'm interested in is when that row of data is moved to the other sheet by the macro, so I want the value that formula gives to freeze when it is transferred.

Thank you for the help!

Sounds like you want to paste values.

To copy row 1 and paste values to row 2:

    range("1:1").copy
    range("2:2").pastespecial paste:=xlpastevalues

If you want the formats to be the same, add the following:

    range("2:2").pastespecial paste:=xlpasteformats

Do you need to preserve formulas in any of the other columns?
