Gold for best answer: Need help with transposing a big database

I have a database of 4000 leads. The information came in a excel format. Here is a  screen shot of current format and desired format.  http://imgur.com/a/qYGiF I'll dish out gold for the first person  that can help me out.

Image is a little blurry, but I think this will work

Formula in H4:

    =INDEX(A:A,(ROW($A1)-1)*4+6)

Formula in I4 (copied through K4)

    =INDEX($B:$B,(ROW($A1)-1)*4+5+COLUMN(A$1))

In L4:

    =INDEX(C:C,(ROW($A1)-1)*4+6)

In M4:

    =INDEX(E:E,(ROW($A1)-1)*4+6)

Copy all formulas downward as needed.

Select everything. Create a table (ctrl-t). With the table selected, go to Data --> Get & Transform --> From Table. This will open power query.

On the Home tab, click Remove Rows --> Remove Blank Rows. Go to the Transform tab. Select all columns, click Fill --> Down. Go back to the Home tab, click Close & Load.

The image is a bit blurry, but it looks like this wouldn't be too difficult to turn into a cleaner format like you're showing on the right. I think I'd approach it with a combination of OFFSET and MATCH formulas. 

Are each of the values in column A unique?
