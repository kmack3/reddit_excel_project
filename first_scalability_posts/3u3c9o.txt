Big spreadsheets - Better to keep as range or format as table?

I work with large spreadsheets (50,000+ rows, dozens of columns) on a daily basis. These often include various formulas, and from them I generate various pivot tables.

My boss likes to always convert the raw data spreadsheets to tables. I was told by a friend who knows excel well, however, that it is better to keep the data as a range.

Which do you suggest? Thanks :)

Tables are pretty handy, lets you easily add a pivot, lets you add data and automatically update formulas that rely on them, lets you apply conditional formatting / formulas that extend automatically as you add more data, etc. 

Tables also have the benefit that, with the 2013-2016 data model feature, they can be added directly to the data model you are working with. 

I still have mixed feelings about them, though. Mostly the table-notation annoys me, especially in a big spreadsheet, I can usually read "what" the data is, but I can't see "where" it is, I guess I'm just used to reading ranges, if people use weird column and table names, simple formulas can also become incredible long. 

There have been some reports of tables slowing things down a bit, this post and its related comments touch on that topic: https://fastexcel.wordpress.com/2012/01/30/excel-2010-tableslistobject-slow-update-and-how-to-bypass/

I personally usually work in ranges, pretty much always actually. I use tables when I either have to work with a data model, data that I will be updating, and especially data sheets that OTHER people will be updating. The automatic extension of formulas + copied down formatting, and some clever use of sheet "protection", can make a fairly butter-finger-safe data entry sheet.

Range if you want to keep working with it in as dynamic fashion as possible.

However, benefits of a table is that it auto-extends as you add data to it.
