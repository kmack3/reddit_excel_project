How do I delete cells which seem to go on forever?

Hi. I had to concatenate some fields together, so I used a command like =A1&"-"&B1&"."&C1 and pressed CTRL+ENTER.

Now, I have a column that has the data I need for about 33000 rows, and everything below that is "-.". It is making my spreadsheet too big and Excel crashes every time I open it.

How can I solve this problem?

Thank you

Go to the first row that you want to delete.

Click with the mouse in the number of the row, to select the whole row.

Press the following keys: Shift + Ctrl + Down arrow. Pressing and holding all of them.

You'll select all the rows bellow the first one you selected. If is necesary press Down arrow several times (while still holding Shift + Ctrl)

Once you reached the bottom of the sheet, mouse right click and Choose: Delete Rows.

**Warning:** Save it with a different name, just in case something went wrong, to don't loose your previous work. You will not see the results until you save the file. Save it, and then all the extra rows at the bottom will be dissapear. 

Close and open the file again, after save it, to confirm.

____________________________
Explanation: Shift key is to select, Ctrl key is to move to the next gap and the down arrow key indicates the direcction.

Turn off calculations (Google this) and then load the file.

Or alow for blank handling e.g.

    IF(ISBLANK(A1),",CONCATENATE(A1,"-",B1......))
