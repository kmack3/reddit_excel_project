In a big data sheet, removing only entire rows with weekend dates (Sat, Sun) out of multiple years with historical exchange rates

I have a huge data sheet with exchange rates for USD-RUB that I need to apply to another set of historical prices, the only problem is that the USD-RUB rates show every exchange rate for the last 15 years, including weekend-rates, but my other data sets only shows weekdays. 
So I need a formula, or even a filter or "find & delete" function that would delete every row with historical Sat, Sun dates. It would need to delete the entire row.

I have spent a lot of time trying to figure this out, and searching online, but what stops me is that I don't know the specifics of what to search for as I haven't stumbled on any example like this one.

You could use WEEKDAY() to find out which dates are Saturday and Sunday, 

For example 

    =WEEKDAY(TODAY(),2) 

will return a 6, and for tomorrow will return a 7... so 6 and 7 are Saturday and Sunday... you could fill down that formula to the column on the right and then you could filter for 6 and 7 and delete those rows... 

Clippy: WEEKDAY
