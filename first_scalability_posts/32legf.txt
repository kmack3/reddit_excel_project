I have an excel test related to Vlookups and pivot tables for a job. I have experience with them, but a while ago. Anyone have a big spreadsheet I can use to play around with to refamiliarize myself?

Might be easier to grab a table of test data [from here](http://www.generatedata.com) and play with that.

There are lots of publically available datasets.  You might start looking here:
