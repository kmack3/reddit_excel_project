I adapted a VBA script to split a big table into several sheets, and it works great. But the table has formulas, and those formulas aren't getting copied.

Office 2016. [Link to the XLSM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-eImg-rTggdVThReUEzV21kTWc/view). Names are fake.

Here's the macro:

    Option Explicit
    Sub CreateSheetsCopyData()
    
            Dim ar As Variant
            Dim i As Integer
            Dim LR As Long
            Dim c As Range
            Dim ws As Worksheet, ws1 As Worksheet
    
    Set ws1 = Worksheets("SplitIntoSheets")
    LR = ws1.Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row
    ar = ws1.Range("A2", ws1.Range("A" & ws1.Rows.Count).End(xlUp))
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    For Each c In ws1.Range("A2:A" & LR)
            Set ws = Nothing
            On Error Resume Next
            Set ws = Worksheets(c.Value)
            If ws Is Nothing Then
            Worksheets.Add(After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count)).Name = c.Value
            End If
      Next c
    
    For i = 0 To UBound(ar)
             Sheets(ar(i, 1)).UsedRange.ClearContents
             ws1.Range("A1", ws1.Range("A" & ws1.Rows.Count).End(xlUp)).AutoFilter 1, ar(i, 1)
             ws1.[A1].CurrentRegion.Copy Sheets(ar(i, 1)).Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp)
             Sheets(ar(i, 1)).Columns.AutoFit
        Next i
    ws1.[A1].AutoFilter
    ws1.Select
    Application.CutCopyMode = False
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    MsgBox "Sheets created/Data transfer completed!", vbExclamation, "Status"
    
    End Sub

**What works**

In the "SplitIntoSheets" worksheet, to the right of the table is a button. Clicking the button runs the macro which splits the table into three sheets (or as many sheets are there are students). The sheets are named for each student and the contents of the table are copied over.

**What doesn't work**

The "SplitIntoSheets" table has a simple =SUM() formula in column AH to calculate the total minutes for each month. I would like for this formula to be included in each of the new sheets. However, only the *first* sheet created captures that formula.

Does the VBA code need to be tweaked so that each sheet receives formulas from the "SplitIntoSheets" table?


-------------
Note that `Range.Value` is different from `Range.Formula`. You have to know which thing to copy over if you are being specific.
