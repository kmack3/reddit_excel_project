Need to extract data from a big excel sheet. The example screenshot which gives the format is given.

I have a big excel sheet which is filled in by various people, i do not control the format as it is in use for a long time. However, There is some data which is useful for me, which I am finding difficult to extract for a large number of rows.

The image gives and example of the data format in the sheet.
Assume, IA1 and IA2 are 2 resources which different projects (Here M and K) are sharing. 
The total usage of IA1 is got by using SUMIFS function.
The allocated work is in Column 3, DynM, StatM, DynK, StatK....
Since IA1 and IA2 are shared on number of projects, I want a summary of where they are allocated (atleast allocation=>0.5). 
So in the circled Cell, I want "DynM" to appear, since IA1 is allocated to DynM.
Bonus: this would be if for IA1 in Column 7 I would get DynM-DynK.
As mentioned above, this is a simplified example, The sheet I have has multiple projects with multiple resources, so this will be applied on a large scale. Thanks if you can help.

Antimutt, thanks for pointing in the right direction, I am having problem defining stringconcat function. Could you help with that? as in start with the basics please.
I am able to partially solve the problem using Concatenate function on a small scale but for the big sheet, the Stringconcat function has to work I suppose.
Thanks

[Here's how](http://www.contextures.com/xlvba01.html) to add the code and there's more links at the bottom of that page.
