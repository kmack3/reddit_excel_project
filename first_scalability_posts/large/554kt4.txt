Looking to find and sort duplicates for a large number of rows.

I am looking to find and sort duplicates of a large list of numbers. I want to be able to sort them and if the number of duplicates equals 5, 10, or 14, I want to put a value in the next column. The rest of the numbers that are either 4 or less will be deleted. 

Does anyone know if this is possible? I will be happy to expand about this if needed. 

Thanks!!

Use a formula like this in a new column:

    =IF(COUNTIFS(A:A,A2)=5,"do something","")

Change `A` to be the column where your data is.

Then, sort on the new column. 

Obviously, this only addresses the 'dups' counting 5, and there are ways to handle 5, 10, or 14 all in one go. Since I don't know exactly what you want to do, I will just keep it simple for now. 

Warning: depending on how much data is being tested, this could take time to calculate. I tested on 10,000 rows and it took about 1 second.

So this kinda does what I want it to. Is there a way I can apply that to an entire list instead of one specific cell?  Also, if the number of duplicates are between 5-10 and between 10-14, then they should round down to 5 or 10.

Hello!

It looks like you tried to award a ClippyPoint, but you need to reply to a particular user's comment to do so, rather than making a new top-level comment.

Try this formula instead:

    =5*INT(COUNTIFS(A:A,A2)/5)

This formula will just give the dup count rounded down to a multiple of 5. You can then sort, or whatever you need from there. 

You can fill this formula (or the other one I posted) down next to your entire list as well.

This does help!! Now, since 14 isn't a multiple of 5, would there be a way to find if these numbers have 14 duplicates?

I think you would benefit from this:

    =COUNTIFS(A:A,A2)

Nice and simple (\^:

Thanks to your help (and some changes on my end), I made all of this work. Thanks for your help!!
