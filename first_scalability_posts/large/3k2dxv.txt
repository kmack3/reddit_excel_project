How to merge large number of rows

Hey guys!

I need to merge large number of cells. When I'm trying to do that - it only shows me the first one on the left.

Let's say that I've few rows of cells:

JDPWIJFJ233.EX | PODMOWEM23.EX | DSJHS234.EX	

I need them to look like: JDPWIJFJ233.EXPODMOWEM23.EXDSJHS234.EX or JDPWIJFJ233.EX PODMOWEM23.EX DSJHS234.EX to put them into particular software (string of text). How to do that? I can't do that by simple 'merge cells' function (it shows only one cell).

Thanks for help guys.
Cheers!

Concatonating. There is a 'wizard' that can do it in the formula tab, or you can do it like this: =A1&A2&A3&A4

if you want to put spaces in there, you can add them like this: =A1&" - "&A2&" - "&A3&" - "&A4

In a new cell enter =Cell1&Cell2&Cell3

Thanks for the tips. As I mentioned before - I'm working with large numbers of cells - like 1000 or even 5000. I won't do it manually with & sign :D Anyway, thanks for help.

I've found the solution. All we  need to do is use =CONCATENATE, we give the array and hit F9. Then we delete { } and hit ENTER - done :)

Thanks for the help guys!

Incidentally, if anyone has a more complex formula for applying this to a range, i'm all ears.
-------------
Import as a table into Power Query, add new column, new column formula is: =[column1] & [column2] & [column3].  Delete the other columns.  Load table to new worksheet.  
-------------
Save the range as text or csv in a separate file, then import through the data tab?
