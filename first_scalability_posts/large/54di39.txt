Isolating large ranges of cells to export

I have an excel sheet of just over 1 million "leads". They are organized in this fashion: first name, last name, address, city, postal code, contact #.

I need to isolate every city and export it to a new excel sheet.

Is there any way I can easily select a range based on a variable (city)?


I am using Excel 2013

Edit 1: I feel I should maybe be more clear: when I say I need to isolate every city, i mean i need to isolate every lead in said city and export those leads to a new excel sheet.

Use a [PIVOT Table](http://www.excel-easy.com/data-analysis/pivot-tables.html) to show unique values, then Copy Paste Special Values the result.

This is amazing, thanks!

edit 1: i lied, im having an issue lol. see this image;

Don't put that in columns. Excel only has a limited number of columns (what are you going to do with 11,000 columns?)

Put the City as a Filter, then everything you wish to export as a row. Show data in Tabular form, and remove all the subtotals.

After the pivot table is looking nice, go to Pivottable Tools > Analyze > Options > Show Report Filter Pages. Excel will create 1 page per city which you can then export to your heart's desire.

ahh okay thats looking much better, thanks. just one question, I need to have the city as a row as well as being able to have it under filter but its not letting me assign it to both. is there any way to get around this?
-------------
Put that in the rows, and filter from there.

If i do that, i am unable to "Show report filter pages"
-------------
Yup. Can't have everything :(

Actually you can if you duplicate the cities column, and use one for the dupe and one for the row...

But in all honesty, you're already filtering by city. Why do you need it in a row? It's all gonna be the same city anyway.

ya i was trying to do that but its as if the whole sheet is protected. like I cant add in a row say at the top. It wont let me shift any cells :( I'll see if I can maybe copy and paste into a new sheet and add in another column there.

Thanks for the help btw, even if this doesn't work I'm sure ill be able to make ti work.

I need the city in a row because the sheets are being uploaded to a dialing software and the lead needs that info in the system
