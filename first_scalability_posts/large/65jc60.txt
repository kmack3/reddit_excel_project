Need help efficiently sorting through a very large Spreadsheet

There are two spreadsheets.

1. The master spreadsheets with a column of case numbers and a second column with those case's status. Includes every single case we have.

2. My spreadsheet which is the same but has a smaller subset of cases with concerns that I need to investigate

I want the master spreadsheet to be searched and for Excel to automatically match case numbers with their statuses in the second column and autofill the spreadsheet I'm working on. 

The act of manually searching each case number for the status is proving tedious. 


-------------
Search youtube for 'excel vlookup'. You can link the case numbers in your worksheet to the master sheet and find all associated statuses at once.
-------------
Is the master sheet just a separate sheet or a completely different workbook?
-------------
I would use INDEX MATCH if it's truly a massive amount of data. 

=INDEX ( *column to return value from* , MATCH ( *lookup value* , *lookup against column* ,0))




-------------
I feel like I got a handle on it, but I'm still getting an error in my formula.

Here's my formula: =VLOOKUP(A80,Master,2,False)

The number I want to look up is in cell A80.

"Master" is the range name that includes two columns. The first is a list of case numbers, the second is their status.

The cell I'm entering the formula in cares about the SECOND column from the "Master" range so I use 2.

I want exact matches so I use "False"

I keep getting a #N/A error though. I feel like I'm doing everything right. I did the search using the simple find function and the case number is definitely in there. 
-------------
if its a different workbook you may need to do something like =vlookup(A80,[Master.xlsm]Sheet1!$A:$B,2,false)
-------------
You may need to ensure you're looking to and from cells of the same type. For various reasons, Excel may consider one a number and the other text. 

To make sure the plumbing is right, manually create a matching in the to and from columns. (a successful lookup tells you it's wired correctly)

A failure means you may have to override the range formatting to number on either side. I've even had to override this seemingly failsafe method with hackery like looking up to a cell * 1 depending on how the data was sourced. 
-------------
Try throwing abs() or trim in there. There's a good possibility that either the information your looking up or the information your searching has a few extra spaces before or after it in the cell.
-------------
Using quotes around master?
-------------
Hmmm I am getting an error on the master table that says 

"The number in this cell is formatted as text or is preceded by an apostrophe."

When I hover over the case numbers. Is that effecting it?

EDIT: This was it! I converted them to numbers and it worked!
-------------
Hey, that's a cool workaround. Thanks! 
-------------
What does abs() or trim mean?
-------------
Abs(absolute value, returns absolute value of a cell) trim(trims the extra spaces before or after the contents of a cell)

You'll have to insert a column on the one sheet if this is the case, just take the case numbers, Trim them into a new column and Vlookup that data.

If this is the issue it should clear it up pretty quickly.
