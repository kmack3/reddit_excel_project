Am I able to create a large, reference cell that changes based on another cell that is selected?

What I'm interested in doing is creating a cell that will show expanded notes based on what cell in a table is selected.

Ideally, it would duplicate the cell notes of the selected cell. The other, more time-consuming option, might be to duplicate the cell contents entirely, and I would include those additional notes in the actual table, but just keep them hidden by fixing the size of the cell so they don't appear in the source cell.

You could concatenate the cells and use references to any user input if I'm understanding you correctly

It'll have to be in VBA, I believe.

Use the SelectionChange event.
 
    Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
        range("a1").value = selection.value
    End Sub


is a quick example

You mean a comment or the whole cell being the "note"?

Hmm, I wasn't able to get anything to work using this.

Since it was hard to explain, I mocked up a quick example [of what I was thinking](http://imgur.com/a/d8yFo). Hopefully this is helpful.

I don't have Excel at home but try this.
Alt+F11 to open VBA editor.

Double click Thisworkbook on the left pane to open a workspace where you can type VBA codes. ( I dunno what's that called)


Paste the code below. I modified the code to work with your screenshot.

    Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
        thisworkbook.sheets("Sheet1").range("D4").value = selection.value
    End Sub

The above code can be improved but for your needs, it looks sufficient.
