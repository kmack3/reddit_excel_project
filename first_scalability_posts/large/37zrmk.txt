Extracting a string of text from a large text cell?

If there is a large cell of text, aka comment description. Is it possible to extract only the part of the cell? aka

The game was great we were parked at Gate: A over at the other end. 

I only want to pull out "Gate: A"


There are four gates.

Try this:

=MID(A1,FIND("Gate:",A1),7)

where 'A1' is the cell of the original text.

You can use text functions like MID and FIND (there are many others) to do this. It'll be something like:

    =MID(A1,FIND("Gate",A1,1), 6)

Experiment with this, change the offset numbers and see what results you get.
