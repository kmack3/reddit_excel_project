Excel keeps changing the cent amount when I type in a large dollar value?

I am working in Excel with large dollar figures.  When I type in a value, for example $5,555,555,555,555.55 everything works out fine and displays exactly as I typed it.  If I try to add another digit though, such as $55,555,555,555,555.55, then press enter, Excel automatically changes it to $55,555,555,555,555.50.  How can I correct this?

Excel's number precision stops at 15 digits from what I could see [Source](https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3)

You're working with 55 trillion dollars and sweating 5 cents?  There's only about [75 trillion dollars globally](http://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/).  Why not divide your figures by some multiple of 1,000 like they do in the graph I linked?

Well that's annoying.  Thanks for the reply!

I've given up on the project, its not worth it if its not accurate.  If its not worth doing right, then its not worth doing at all.

I agree.  Sorry if I didn't really make my point well.  To me this is a significant digits problem.  If you really need more than 15 digits of accuracy -- and in most practical applications, I don't think you do -- then Excel is not the tool to use.
