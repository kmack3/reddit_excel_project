I'm currently working on a large project, 160+tabs, what's the best way to organise for quick access to any given tab?




-------------
There is a free for personal use utility calles ASAP Utilities, which has among many features, a create index of shhets feature. Also AnalysisTabs has the same feature.

-------------
If you're willing to put in the work I'd say to put in an 'Index' tab where you can create hyperlinks to the individual tabs. You can break them out by category, or alphabetical order, whatever is most applicable to your workbook.
-------------
Thanks guys, I downloaded ASAP utilities, got it working nicely

-------------
This... And perhaps add a button on each tab hyperlinking back to the index
-------------
Agreed. When I'm creating a large workbook I tend to name each tab on the tab, you can make that the hyperlink back to the index
-------------
I've done something similar but using the on double click method for that sheet.
