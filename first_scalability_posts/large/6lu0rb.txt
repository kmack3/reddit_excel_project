If statement calculator. Large statement and getting confused. Do I need a nested If?

So I'm working on an "If" statement for a calculator for our HR department at work to say how much the firm will pay and how much the employee owes.

Here are the stipulations:

* First $50.00 monthly expense - firm will pay 100%

* Monthly expenses from $50.01 to $200.00 - the firm will pay 30%

* Monthly expenses from $200.01 to $500.00 - the firm will pay 50%

* Expenses in excess of $500 will not be covered

The caveat to all this is that it will be tiered.  So if the person has a $300 parking expense it will be as follows:

$300 - ($50 paid for firm) = $250

The $250 will then fall into two categories: $150 of it will be at the 30% firm pay and $100 will be at the 50% firm pay.

So I'm trying to enter the parking amount into cell B5 and get the amount he firm will be paying.

=IF(AND($B5<=50),50,IF(AND($B5>50,$B5<=200),((($B5-50)-50)*0.3)+50,IF(AND($B5>200,$B5<=500),(($B5-200)*0.5)+50,IF(AND($B5>500),0))))

I can't figure out how to make a balance split into two percentage ranges.  I'm still working and trying to write out the logic on paper, so I'll post up if I find anything, but if there's a better way to do this, I'm all ears.

Thanks!

You can do this like so:

    =IF(B8<50,B8,IF(B8<200,50+(B8-50)*30%,IF(B8<500,95+(B8-250)*50%,245)))

Because the amounts for each level once filled are fixed, you can just use the direct amounts.
-------------
`=MIN(B5,50)+IF(B5>50,MIN(B5-50,150)*0.3)+IF(B5>200,MIN(B5-200,300)*0.5)`
-------------
So I used VBA to solve this since you can make your own functions there and I find the logic easier to work with Case statements. I made two Identical functions where one would output for the employee expense and one for the firm expense. Just copy and paste these into a visual basic module and you should be set.

Employee (in the spreadsheet you would just type =EmployeeParkingExpense(B5) and it would give you the calculation.  

    Function EmployeeParkingExpense(fSheetCell As Double)
    
    Dim fEmployeeEx As Double
    Dim fFirmEx As Double
    
    Select Case fSheetCell
    
        Case Is <= 50#
            fFirmEx = fSheetCell
            fEmployeeEx = 0
            
        Case Is <= 200#
            fFirmEx = (fSheetCell - 50) * 0.3 + 50
            fEmployeeEx = fSheetCell - fFirmEx
        
        Case Is <= 500#
            fFirmEx = 50 + 45 + ((fSheetCell - 200) * 0.5)
            
            fEmployeeEx = fSheetCell - fFirmEx
            
        Case Is > 500#
            
    End Select
            
    EmployeeParkingExpense = fEmployeeEx
    
    End Function  


Firm, same thing, but =FirmParkingExpense(B5)  

    Function FirmParkingExpense(fSheetCell As Double)
    
    Dim fEmployeeEx As Double
    Dim fFirmEx As Double
    
    Select Case fSheetCell
    
        Case Is <= 50#
            fFirmEx = fSheetCell
            fEmployeeEx = 0
            
        Case Is <= 200#
            fFirmEx = (fSheetCell - 50) * 0.3 + 50
            fEmployeeEx = fSheetCell - fFirmEx
        
        Case Is <= 500#
            fFirmEx = 50 + 45 + ((fSheetCell - 200) * 0.5)
            
            fEmployeeEx = fSheetCell - fFirmEx
            
        Case Is > 500#
            
    End Select
            
    FirmParkingExpense = fFirmEx
    
    End Function  
 

This requires a macro enabled workbook, so save it as one.

should be `IF(B8<500,95+(B8-200)*50%,245)`

Ok, that got me pointed in the right direction. I didn't think of the amount being fixed like that.

I'm having to tweak it a little,but that probably had more to do with my explanation of the policy.

I'll post up my results shortly.  Thanks!

This is what I'm currently working with.

=IF(B5<50,B5,IF((B5-50)<200,50+(((B5-50)-50)*0.3),IF((B5-50)<500,95+(B5-250)*50%,245)))

I'm stuck on the 3rd leg.

Arguments are as follows:

1.  If B5<50, B5
2.  If (B5-50)<200, 50+((B5-50)-50)*30%

I think step 2 is where the logic gets a little hairy. 

Let me try to make more sense....

Parking Cost: 165

Firm pay: 50

115 Balance

Of that balance, firm will pay 30% of the amount that falls between 50 and 150.

So of that, 65 falls in that range.  So 65*30% = $19.50.

So firm will pay Original $50+19.50 = 69.50

I've got the first 2 if statements working with what I've added above, but am stuck on the 3rd.  I've just been at this so long I'm having a hard time thinking outside of the box...

This gives the correct answer if the amount is $300, which is $145.

If I enter a parking amount of $165 into this, the answer should be 69.50, but I'm getting 84.50.

Edit:  Hold that thought.....

Edit Edit:  I think this is it.  Need to do some testing.

You are correct, with that amendment the function should work.

This policy explanation is different to before, but sounds a bit... off to me.  You are subtracting the $50 threshold twice - once to get the amount of $115, and again after that.  That doesn't sound right to me - I'd expect it to be that you are splitting the $165 into $50 into the 100% bucket, $100 in the 30% bucket, and $15 in the 50% bucket.  But the system you describe is a bit weird and I'm not sure I know what the third step is even supposed to be doing.

$50 + ($165-$50)*30% = $84.50 

84.50 is the correct answer based on the tiered logic you've described. First 50 covered at 100%, remainder is covered at 30%. 

It may help you out if you set up a table rather than try to do this all in a single formula.

Spot-on.  This worked.

I agree - it sounds a bit off to me as well.  I think that's why I'm struggling so hard.

I'm headed to HR to get some clarification...because this is a little ridiculous IMO.   Thanks for sticking with me!

You're right.  This works.  I visited with HR and got some clarification.  This is perfect.
