Need help with a basic query of a large .csv file

Fairly new to excel,  I have a large .csv file with youtube video titles/length/views. I want to query the video titles for recurring words within the titles and shoot the top 1000 words to a new sheet. I'm having trouble finding resources to aid me. Can anyone help me get started?

Edit: File size is 3.15 GB

If you already have a list of words you want to look for then you can do this with a COUNTIF() function.  If you want Excel to create the list for you and then count the number of occurrences then you're going to need a series of larger formulas or VBA.  I recommend using VBA for something like this.
-------------
Writing this comment on my mobile so bear with me. 

Copy all the titles onto column A in a new worksheet. Now do "text to columns" (alt + a, e) on column A. Choose spaces as your delimiter. This will explode the titles from one column into many (my guess is about 10 new columns). Copy this worksheet (copy 2 will be used later) 

Now, using cut, stack those ten columns into one column. Once all the individual words are in one column (lets say they are back in col A), sort the column (alt + a, s, a). 

Now "remove duplicates" on Column A. (alt + a, m) 

You now have a list of all words in the title. 

Do a countif() comparing this list of all individual words and reference the worksheet that contains the exploded titles. 

Sorry, this likely makes no sense but it is a ~10 min method that does not involve VBA

Seems like you'd be better off using Access for that.

Maybe see if someone can help you write a creative SQL query.

I would take a stab at it using Power Query.  You should be able to attach to the .csv (even at 3 GB) without issue, get rid of the extra columns, space delimit the title column, unpivot the results, get rid of blank rows, then group the resulting word list with an added column for count.  Best of all, when you have a new csv, just refresh the query.

Edit: Of course, return the result to an Excel worksheet
-------------
thanks for the help! Yeah I want excel to create the list for me based on the recurring words in the list, do you have any VBA resources that could help me out? 

Edit: CSV file is 3.15 GB if that changes how to approach the problem as well
-------------
Holy Moly, 3.5GB! I don't think this method would work.
-------------
Yeah that what I've been reading is the best way to go about it, the file is zipped right now. Can you query a zipped csv file or should I extract first?
-------------
3.15Gb is too much for Office to handle directly. Use Access to link to the file (rather than load it as a table) and the create a query than only picks out the *names* field. Saved as it's own csv, this may reduce it enough that you can load it into an Excel sheet, using *spaces* as the delimiters. *Removing duplicates*, for each column of words, for a copy of the sheet, will give a word list to base a COUNTIF on.
-------------
So the way I would approach this would be to start with the CSV inside the Excel document.  If this is a recurring process then you can start the code with uploading the CSV to a spreadsheet.  Then you can create a Dictionary to hold all the individual words.  The Dictionary object will allow you to hold the full list without any duplicates.  Then you can loop through each title in your list, extract each individual word by splitting the spring with a space, dash, and/or comma delimiter.  With each word you find, it will be placed in the dictionary.  Once you have your full list you can search for each occurrence in your title list.  Then you can paste the list to another spreadsheet to view.  
  
If you're unable to get a start on this by tomorrow, I'll walk you through it when I get back to work.  Good Luck.

Yeah the file size is killing me, I am able to load the file in excel ,after quite some time, and choose space as the delimiter but when I run the count if function the whole thing crashes. I have been reading about a way to query the csv file without actually unpacking it.Have any experience with that?

-------------
I've never tried connecting to a zipped .csv but I'm guessing you will need to extract first.
-------------
Thanks! I think this is the best way to go about it. From what I read I need to remove the unwanted columns before loading it as a table like you suggested. I know there is a way to query the csv directly, but I think thatll be a project for another day, i like your method of making a manageable sized csv with just the relevant info
-------------
Alright awesome that seems like great way to go about it! I'll study the dictionary object and give it a go, thanks for the help.  
-------------
Sorry, no. I only have rudimentary advice which is:  Delete everything but the titles, and save as a xlxb.

How many rows is this? 
-------------
I would not try and load a 3.15GB file. You will be waiting all day, then it will crash!.. or any effort to work on it will be met with an iceage slow response..


-------------
Geez, I just noticed the file size.  Is the entire file just Title Names or does it have other information as well?
-------------
1.8m rows X 8 columns, I only need the 1 column though
-------------
Yeah thats been killing me, even when I do get the file to load, it crashes whenever I try to run any type of extraction on the data. The file contains other information as well. Do you know a way to remove unwanted columns before unpacking the file? I've been researching power query, have any experience with that?
-------------
Import the data into a database, even MSACCESS might work, query the columns and data you require and export them. Assuming the resultant dump will still be of a usable size for poor little Excel :(

If not then [download and install MS SQL Express Edition](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/sql-server-express.aspx) and have a look at [this article](http://www.experts-exchange.com/questions/25059415/Word-frequency-counter-without-Full-text-index.html) for the query that may work for you. Assuming the Express Edition is not limited in functionality.
