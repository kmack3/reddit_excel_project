How to rank a large list into 5 groups?

I have a file with about 250 names, each with 10 columns of data points. I need to find an easy way to do a weighted ranking of each of these (most important to least important) to make a final sorting of all the 250 names into 5 top to bottom ranked groups. 

    

I hope my question makes sense! I've got moderate experience with excel but I'm not sure how to go about this without a lot of manual work.

Why not create an 11th column that contains a sum of the data points, where each data point has a coefficient that provides "weight" to the value. That way, column 1 may be worth 20% of the total "score", and column 2 may be worth 1%. But at final column, you have a single, sortable number that weighs each person's scores and can rank them accordingly. Then you simply group them manually.

The equation in column L would be like this:

`=0.2*C1 + 0.01*D1 + 0.18*E1 + ... + 0.XX*K1`

Change the coefficients accordingly, or even enter the values in cells elsewhere in the sheet, so you can change them easily.

Is each data point numeric? Are you looking for top quintile, 2nd quintile, etc.?

What might work is to add a column for each data point to calculate that person's group (1-5) for that data type.  This might require an array formula, especially if you need to account for people being added to the list.

Can you post sample data?

Thank you! That makes perfect sense. I'm still a novice at Excel but when I wrap my head around logic it all clicks into place, you helped me do that, I think I have a plan now.

Its all numeric data, and grouping into percentiles would work (top 20%, 40% etc)

  
Here's an example:

Re-reading your post, it sounds like you want to assign a weight to each metric, and then rank them by combined score, so /u/acerebral is on the right track.

The difficult part is to figure out what the correct weighting is - that's something you'll have to do on your own.

To make the combined Metric, put the weighting into row 1 (above your table), with a percentage for each metric.  You can start with 10% for everything, in cells C1 to K1.

Then in Cell B3, put this formula.

    =SUMPRODUCT($C$1:$K$1,C3:K3)

That gives me a score of 2700.4 for Employee 1.

Thank you so much for taking time to look at this! I think I understand how I can do this now.

That makes a lot of sense and its really interesting that can be seen from such a small sample. I really appreciate the help!
