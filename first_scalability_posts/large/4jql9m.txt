Where can I download large excel files

For my final project in university, I want a large excel file or a large database that I can export to an excel file.. I still can't find where can I download such files!

http://www.mockaroo.com/ should be able to generate something for you.

Or start with that, and use RANDBETWEEN() to help multiply the data up.

You can get a bunch of baseball data on fangraphs.com and it exports as an excel file.

Static data? Many datasets available at the US Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics site. Download as CSV, open in Excel, save as XLSX.
