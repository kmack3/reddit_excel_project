Have you had a good experience creating a database from VERY large Excel sheets?

I have 12 VERY large excel sheets, one for each month of the year, with 100 columns, and ~600K rows per file.


We use the data in these files for multiple purposes, but everytime we need to, we're faced with having to open each file (~150 MB), doing the necessary filter/look-up or whatever else we're doing, then redo the same on the next file.

I figured it might be better to instead upload all 12 files into a database, and then do purpose-specific subsets out of the database afterwards.

I tried importing the sheets into Access 2010, and ran into a very long freeze, followed by an error about the failure of import wizards. So I manually trimmed a couple of files into small subsets, and the import worked just fine, making it definitely relative to how big the files are.


And I was wondering if any of you ran into the same, and found a good solution, an alternative to Access maybe?

I think you can import the data to access (in worst case as CSV?); and then use Excel to connect to access... so that you will be making a pivot table on basis of the access engine; I think Excel had this MS Query thing that was killed and is called differently nowdays that allows to build queries, but for real queries Access would probably be better... but for simple selects - maybe Excel still
-------------
With Access, it may look like it is freezing, but it may be taking a really long time.  One other consideration is if you are running your files locally or across a network.  When importing, it may be useful to do things locally... for that matter, a lot that is done in access is better done locally, depending on your connection.  Some of the access DBs I was saddled with would take up to an hour to run certain processes.  Anything longer than that I would just move the entire db locally, run it, then move it back.  It really shouldn't be much faster, but it was. /shrug.

Glad I don't have to go back to those days.

That said, for the number of records you are talking about, access is likely fine.  You can probably get away with excel for a while... but I would at least want to have the data in access as a backup.  IF it is about the reports, you can always have an excel front end pull data from access... for that matter you can even have the excel front end write to access.  This can really help if you have users that don't want to learn anything new... that said, probably not the preferred method, but it can get the job done.

On the DB side if you google there are a number of neat templates that have user forms that add rows/records etc and manage almost as if in access, I haven't looked for them in years, but they are there.  I personally prefer to reinvent the wheel, as it is usually faster than looking through someone else's chicken scratch code, plus it gives me something to be embarrassed of a year down the road lol.

I personally would just go into Access if you are already familiar with it.  I have used front ends from access and excel before, and I can tell you people much prefer to drive their reporting and input from excel than access.  (though that could be some comment on my ability/inability to build good UIs in access as well... hmmm)
-------------
Sounds like you already have it figured out, but if you are up for another move, SQL is better and faster than Access IMO and it appears the free version now supports 10GB of data->[source]( http://www.microsoft.com/web/platform/database.aspx).

You should still be able to use Excel to pull from SQL using Powerpivot as a previous Redditor mentioned.

The downside is if you have to do a query actually from the DB, SQL doesn't have a nice UI to kind of do it in a drag and drop way; you would have to learn at least some basic SQL coding.

Or I think you could pull a subset of your data into Access from SQL also.

Good luck.

You're likely using the wrong tool for a job. I had a similar setup. Ultimately we built an Access db.

I don't have any experience with sheets that large or with database products, but I know that the powerpivot addin for excel 2010 can use other spreadsheets as it's database "source", and then you can maybe look up DAX expressions to get just what you're looking for?

with regard to access, maybe try saving your spreadsheets as .xlsb files, I hear they are much smaller for large datasets (but not 100% backwards compatible), and then import that?

I've had to handle 19 million records outside of a database before. You can do it through Access. Store the file as a csv, and link Access to that file and you can quickly query and generate the information you need. DO NOT import it.

CSV worked :) thanks a lot.
-------------
Another option is to cut and paste... for the life of me I can't think of why a CSV import wouldn't work for the OP... I have to think they are running over a network, and it is just taking a long time.  

Personally I would try to move the file locally (note if the OP is using some sort of faux desktop, where your desktop/"C drive" is really offsite, this won't help much unless you can get to a real local drive.), transfer to a db locally, then back to the server, but if it is this slow for the transfer, certain processes may take longer as well, but it really doesn't sound like the kind of numbers that should be too much of a problem... 
-------------
Thing is, I don't really "need" Excel, I'm just starting from it because that's how the data is delivered to us, in these huge files.

Once I've managed to transform the Excel files into any form of a database, I can work off the database itself (I'm familiar with Access a bit, and writing SQL queries a bit).

My issue right now though, is with creating the database itself from these files. And Access on first attempt, didn't work as described. And I was looking to see if someone had ran into the same and found a way.

Oh and everything I have, I have locally.
-------------
I guess in the worst case you should be able to copy and paste, in chunks into excel... but if you are getting these files often, that isn't going to be a great solution... you should be able to import a csv in the worst case.  

You could be running into trouble with the data types.  There could be an exception somewhere in the data (like a number field that ends up being text in one instance thanks to manual input of a space or something like that.

I guess the first step would be to make sure the data you have is in the format you think it should be/consistent.  Also watch out for headers, I can't remember how the excel wizard imports, but I suspect there is a checkbox for headers vs no headers.
-------------
Hmmm... I just tried converting the file into CSV from XLSX, and imported the CSV file which ended up being much larger in size (400MB from 180MB), yet it worked. I don't understand why, but it worked just fine.

Thanks a lot. I'll continue to add the rest of the year files the same way.
