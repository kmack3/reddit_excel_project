How to easily link to pdfs that would accompany my excel file on a large external flash drive

So, I have about 8000 pdfs that I would like to include with a an excel file that would have around 40 columns and 4000 row entries.  I figured out this:

=HYPERLINK("C:\mypath\" & A2 & ".pdf", "Link") 

I put this in a column to the left of the column I have listing the file names as the "link" to the file.

Problem is this: the path needs to be constant --> won't be if you are launching this from a jump drive.  Any ideas on what would be an easy way to do this?

Thanks!

Why aren't you making a web page that lives on the drive and supports relative paths?
-------------
Could you make a cell include the text that has the path to the PDFs? You either put this on a hidden sheet or just a different cell and then change that single cell and refresh all of the hyperlinks that way. It'd look like:

    =HYPERLINK(Z1 & A2 & ".pdf", "Link")

where Z1 is the cell with the path.

I think you can determine where the file path is for the current Excel file leads to with VBA, but I'm not sure you want to go that route.

Can I ask why you have over 8,000 PDFs that you need to link to?
-------------
How's your VBA? The way I deal with items for shared folders and such is to read in the current path and then use it for the sub folder paths. So it doesn't matter what the person has called their path. You could do a quick read on open and populate a control cell with the path.
-------------
Not sure I understand the limitations here but is there a reason you can't use *relative* links?
E.g if you create a folder called PDFDIR right next to the Excel file which contain all your pdf files you should be able to use =HYPERLINK("PDFDIR\"& A2 & ".pdf", "Link").
That should  work even if you move the Excel file and the pdf dir to a another location.

It's going to places with no internet.  Needs to be on a external memory device.

Making a whole bunch of reference documents easier to access for some field technicians.  Just figuring out if I can do it.
-------------
Browsers work fine with local pages and no internet.

I guess that makes sense. Does my solution work for you? Or do you want to try and go the VBA route?
-------------
What would be the easiest way for me to do that.  I'd be willing to entertain that if it worked better.  I still need a giant sortable spreadsheet though... so that might be harder outside of excel.
-------------
It really could.  I wonder if there would be a way to get that one cell to autoupdate with the path to the flash drive.  But thanks so much for that, good simple solution for the moment.

I don't have access to Excel right now, so I can't check it, but see what happens when you insert the following formula into a cell:

    =MID(CELL("filename"),SEARCH("[",CELL("filename"))+1, SEARCH("]",CELL("filename"))-SEARCH("[",CELL("filename"))-1)

EDIT: [Source.](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/insert-the-current-excel-file-name-path-or-worksheet-in-a-cell-HA010342623.aspx)

EDIT2: Linked to the wrong one. Try the following instead:

    =CELL("filename")

and you should get the address of the file. You may have to do some work to get the cell to just display the address without the name of the spreadsheet at the end, but I don't think it'd be too hard.
