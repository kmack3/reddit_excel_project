(Probably) a simple one: Search through one data set for a large number (>1000) of terms

Hi guys,

I asked a question here a couple months ago and got a really helpful response, so I thought I would try again.

I have one list of over 2200 company names. I have a second list of over 1000 companies with whom we currently have relations. I want to search the list of 2200 companies for companies we already have relations with, and have that appear in a separate list.

As an Excel noob, the only way I would know how to do this is manually, although I assume there must be a straightforward way to ask Excel to search one set of data for all individual terms in a second data set?

Thanks!

You can put a COUNTIF() formula next to each name on one list and see if it shows up on the other list.

I usually do this quite often and it's usually a one-off task.

I use a combination of INDEX and MATCH.

Assuming your list of 2200 companies is in column A and the list of over 1000 companies in column C.

Type this formula in cell B1, which is next to your list of 2200 companies.

    =INDEX(C:C,MATCH(A1,C:C,0))

Where you see #N/A, it means that this particular item is not found in your list of over 1000 companies whom you currently have relations. You can then apply a filter to your list and uncheck the errors and voila, your list of companies. I'm sure there's a better way though...

I've done this! You want [Fuzzy Lookup](http://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/details.aspx?id=15011). It's a free plugin that does a lot of different searches for similarity and gives an overall match score. It is good because it avoids errors where it is not a perfect match (ie. Spelling errors, Pizza Hut vs Pizza Hut Pty Ltd, etc).  Googling Fuzzy Lookup should give you everything you need, but pm me if you need further help

Thanks for the suggestion! I ended up using a different method but I'll keep COUNTIF in mind in future.

You don't even need the index, just the `=MATCH(A1, C:C, 0)` (it'd return either the lookup value or #N/A if the value is not found)

Thanks for the suggestion! I'll take a look at this and see if it could be of use in the future.

You're right :D

Thanks for your suggestion! I ended up using a different method (semi-manual), To be honest I forgot that I had even asked and by the time I realised, I was almost done- only took about 30 minutes in the end though!
