Automate data transfer from large number of workbooks into one destination workbook

I've got about 900 spreadsheets, each in its own workbook file. I'd like to copy or move all that data into a single sheet so I can analyze it as a whole. But I don't want to go into each document, select what I need, and copy/paste x 900. Is there a fast way to do this?

Some other notes:

* I don't need to preserve any formatting.

* All of the source workbooks are laid out exactly the same way, in case that's relevant.

Thanks in advance, folks.

How much data in each spreadsheet?

With that many spreadsheets you are limited to 1165 records each.

Powerquery does this simply.

Hey, thanks for the reply. Each spreadsheet contains 1293 cells of information, but I only need 391 of them.
-------------
I've never used Power Query before, but it looks quite helpful. I'll try this too and get back to you. Thank you.
-------------
That was promising, but I ran into some trouble. How do I limit the rows that get transferred into the target document? I only need the first 27.
-------------
Is all the data in the same range in each worksheet?

what is the range?
-------------
Depending on how you did it, but In the power query editor, after the source is read in, you want to choose to "Keep rows" (and enter the 27).

Make sure you  have the very latest Power query downloaded - the most recent one supports opening a folder and combining all the files in it the same way (it has the option to combine IN the file selection pop-up, which is new...).
-------------
It's all B1:S25

Solution verified

The Powerquery thread posted by u/small_trunks is worth a look, otherwise some VBA can help
If line 1 is the same header for each file, suggest you update B1 below to B2 so you are copying the header over and over again.. Suggest you test on a small batch of files first.


        Sub getFileData()
        Dim objFSO As Object
        Dim objFolder As Object
        Dim objFile As Object
        Dim wb As Workbook: Set wb = ActiveWorkbook
        Dim ws As Worksheet: Set ws = wb.ActiveSheet
        Dim filepath As String: filepath = "D:\data\myExcelfiles"
        Dim target As Range
        Set target = ws.Range("B1:S25") 'set initial paste range
        'Create an instance of the FileSystemObject
        Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
        'Get the folder object
        Set objFolder = objFSO.GetFolder(filepath)
        'loops through each file in the directory and prints their names and path
        For Each objFile In objFolder.Files
            Workbooks.Open (objFile.Path)
            target.Value = ActiveSheet.Range("B1:S25").Value 'copy range
            Workbooks(objFile.Name).Close
            'set the next paste range
            Set target = target.Offset(25, 0) 'increment paste range
        Next objFile
        End Sub

Power query is more *fun*. 
-------------
That looks promising. I will try it at work tomorrow and see. Thank you.
-------------
Haha,.,.probably.. I really want to investigate it more.. 

Curious, can it limit the copying to a smaller range from a large range as per this post requirement?

From what I saw of your link it did not allow.. but surely it could!
-------------
Yes.

- you have the option to discard N rows from the top and/or from the bottom
- you can also filter in/out specific rows when they contain (or don't contain) certain values, words etc. Like a normal column filter, except you're only left with the remaining rows.
- you could add a row number to each file as it comes in and then filter on the range of rows you'd like.
- All of these amendments could be made parameter driven
