Importing data from a very large notepad file

I have a giant list of emails and names someone gave to me as a raw notepad file and I want to export them all into an excel sheet.  Two columns, one for the name and the other for the email. And I want to get rid of the quotes.

The list is structured like this except with actual emails. No line breaks, no spaces.

"Jason Larry","l.jason@yahoo.com","Brian Santo","b.santo@yahoo.com","Jeremey Brison","j.brison@yahoo.com","Angelica Wally","w.angelica@yahoo.com","Michael Sasha","m.sasha@yahoo.com"

It's about 10,000 emails large.



-------------
Open the file in excel, pick TEXT files under file type in the open file dialog.

Then when promoted, use COMMA as the delimiter. This will produce all the data on one row, ROW A. Press CTRL+H and place " in the **FIND WHAT** field and leave blank the **REPLACE WITH** field. This will remove the quotes.

in cell A3, use formula:  

    =INDEX($A:$A,,(((ROW(A1)-1)*2)+1)  

In cell B3, use formula:  

    =INDEX($A:$A,,(((ROW(A1)-1)*2)+2)  

Drag both cells A3 and B3 down 10000 rows or however many emails you have. All the names and emails will appear in Columns A and B.

Hey, I tried this and it worked up until I put the the formulas in A3 and B3. Copying and pasting didn't work. I tried typing them in and I got a circular reference warning in A3 followed by a zero value. In B3 I get a #REF! error.


-------------
Try typing the formula in columns B and C instead, in cells B3 and C3. so in cell B3, use formula:  

    =INDEX($A:$A,,(((ROW(A1)-1)*2)+1)  

In cell C3, use formula:  

    =INDEX($A:$A,,(((ROW(A1)-1)*2)+2)  

-------------
I'm still getting the same error. In B3 there's a 0 and in everything below there's "#REF!" In C3 and below there's "#REF!"

The circular reference is gone though. I'm putting them in precisely as written although in the second batch Excel excel recommended putting an extra parenthesis.

show me a screenshot?
-------------
you put 2 commas after  

    =INDEX($A:$A  
?

This is in Excel 2010

Need to replace the A:A with 1:1 like so, B3:

    =INDEX($1:$1,,(((ROW(A1)-1)*2)+1))  

In cell C3, use formula:  

    =INDEX($1:$1,,(((ROW(A1)-1)*2)+2))

Nice. Thanks a lot. You've seriously just helped me out.
