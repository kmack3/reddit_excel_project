Hide row based on blank cell
Is there a way to hide a row based on whether a cell is blank automatically?

Select "View Code" from the right-click drop-down menu.
Then paste the code below into the window that opens. 

Option Explicit
Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()
    Dim r As Range, c As Range
Set r = Range("a1:a299")
Application.ScreenUpdating = False
For Each c In r
    If Len(c.text) = 0 Then
        c.EntireRow.Hidden = True
    Else
        c.EntireRow.Hidden = False
    End If
Next c
Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
End Sub

Is there a specific column you are looking for blank cells in or is it any column in the row?

How would I repeat this process of multiple ranges?
-------------
Multiple columns and multiple rows so like if a1 b1 c1 and d1 are blank then hide row 1

I'm sure there's a more concise way to do this, but here's a macro that will accomplish what you want as long as you know how many columns your data has.

    Sub hiderow()
    '
    Dim lastrow As Long
    Dim s As String
    Dim x As Integer

    'This will count how many rows are in your data set even if the first column is blank, much better than the traditional .End(xlUp).Row
    With Sheets("Sheet1")
        If Application.WorksheetFunction.CountA(.Cells) <> 0 Then
            lastrow = .Cells.Find(What:="*", _
                      After:=.Range("A1"), _
                      LookAt:=xlPart, _
                      LookIn:=xlFormulas, _
                      SearchOrder:=xlByRows, _
                      SearchDirection:=xlPrevious, _
                      MatchCase:=False).Row
        Else
           lastrow = 1
        End If
    End With


     Application.ScreenUpdating = False
 
     'change x < _ where _ is 1+ the number of columns you'd like to search
  
     x = 1
 
    Do While x < 6
    'This is the actual row hiding method
     For i = 1 To Range("A1:E" & lastrow).Count
         s = i & ":" & i
         If IsEmpty(Cells(i, x).Value) Then
             Rows(s).Select
             Selection.EntireRow.Hidden = True
        End If
     Next
     x = x + 1
     Loop
 
     Application.ScreenUpdating = True
 
    End Sub
