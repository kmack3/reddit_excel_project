Transfer a table with dates and other colums into a calendar type format
I have a sheet that is updated by another user that is a production schedule. It is very hard to read. I'm trying to find a way to take that information and by date transfer it to a monthly view type calendar. That captures the date and some of the other colums.  I'm an advanced beginner.  Running Excel 2013. Because it is work related I can't post any files.  I'm not educated on macros and am ok with formulas. Any help would be great
