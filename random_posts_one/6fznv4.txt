Master formatting template
Is there any way to create an area of a worksheet that has "master template" formatting (cell boarders & colour) so that when that formatted area is copied to other areas of the sheet, all those other areas will change when the "master format" areas is edited?

I have created a sales funnel worksheet with a formatted calculation for each month (pitched, contracted, total earned, etc), copied out from left to right across the sheet. I keep wanting to make editions which means I have to keep editing each other month as well
