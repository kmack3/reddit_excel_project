Trying to make a chart with standard formulas?
I keep an updated golf spreadsheet, and I'm trying to make a line chart to show my scores, based on course and holes played there.  
Ex: I want "Line A" to show my scores for each time I've played "18" holes at "Pinecrest."  
"Line B" to show my scores for each time I've played "9" holes at "Pinecrest."  
  
I've tried a few different formulas, Google, and setting up as a table, but I can't seem to figure out how to make this happen.

Not at a computer, but if you pivot the data, put holes in the bottom left followed by location, and put date at the top, and score as values you should be able the graph that data.

SOLUTION VERIFIED  
  
Thank you for your help!  
  
I thought it would be just as easy setting up a chart without having to pivot, but after some trial and error, [this is what I eventually ended up doing.](http://i.imgur.com/vGIHMsh.png)
