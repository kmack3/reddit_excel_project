Those who make $100K+/year and work in Excel most of the day...what do you do and do you enjoy it?
just a general career type question. curious as to what most of you do that are in the six + figures. 

i'm sure this will get downvoted to oblivion. 


-------------
Project manager. Not specifically required to work in excel, but I choose to. Probably 50% of my time is on Excel and the rest are a combination of other activities. Other PMs in my company use it as much or as little as they want but still use it somehow. 

My coordinator tracks the project and schedule using primavera but I track the project progress, issues, stakeholders, costs, changes, everything in excel. Basically my day involves updating and analyzing how my project is doing then going to meetings to make things happen based on what the spreadsheets tell me, then updating the sheets again. 

But then again I'm crazy with excel. I actually have a spreadsheet of my spreadsheets. 
-------------
Accountant here.  I use excel all day and have 17 years of experience.  My boss asks me to do stuff and is constantly amazed at how quickly I'm able to slice and dice numbers.  Excel is awesome.  
-------------
Excel is the screwdriver of data analysis... everybody has (and has used it) so sharing content is easier (than lets say R)... it's really good at getting things formatted exactly how you want them (unlike tools such as tableau).  It's a fairly robust tool allowing you to abuse it in ways that the creators never intended... however it really has it's limitations like it you cant efficiently use it with 10 million rows or do any complicated statistics.  That being said it is the gateway to many other tools and teaches you how to think.
-------------
I'm not quite in six figures, but I'm close.  I'm in excel/vba a lot of the day, but not all day.  I do modeling and simulation and historical data analysis for a military contactor.  I also occasionally need other tools: python, c++, matlab (though I've moved away from this), tableau, and other purpose built modeling tools.  Excel is useful for displaying a bunch of data and easy/quick manipulation.  It's great because my clients feel comfortable in it and it's easy to fix all the fat-fingered, multi-format data I'm usually stick working with.
-------------
Not too terribly far from six figures (midwest cost of living so may even be worth more) but automation and reporting. People love seeing the pretty picture and the more and more you can accomplish the more your value increases.
-------------
Supply Chain Management and yes I love it.  Obviously one would generally start in an Analyst, Buyer, Planner, etc position and move up from there to a higher paying management role.  Excel is heavily used for almost all analytics and basic planning tools and the better you are with Excel the easier it is to separate yourself from the pack.
-------------
Actuary here - Excel is the primary tool used in financial analysis, rate development, liability valuation, risk contract projection, and a million other things. It is the easiest way to apply judgement to assumptions but still share in a way that others follow along.

Love my job, would recommend the actuarial career to anyone interested in diving into it!
-------------
Intelligence Analyst. Counter-terrorism and Counter-intelligence specifically. 
-------------
I make the Indian equivalent of this figure, I guess. And I love Excel. I don't use it all day, but a fair amount daily. My job is combination of program design and strategy and I like to make decisions based on Excel.

But I think its important to remember that Excel is just a tool... just cos you're good at using it, doesn't mean that you'd be good at interpreting the data as well. I'm really struggling to build this skill in my team.

They feel that if they give me pretty looking graphs and pivot tables then that's analysis. I am trying to get them to realize that these are what you use to analyse stuff. 

And the questions that you want the data to answer are more important.

I really like my work. And I love that when I make decisions they are based in fact and not my whim or perception. And I love looking at large spreadsheets of raw data and then slowly making sense of the chaos.
-------------
Corporate FP&A / Strategic Finance. I love it. 
-------------
[Workforce Management](https://www.thecallcenterschool.com/programs/workforce-management/) - I plan staffing for call centers at the monthly, weekly, daily level. Excel is the primary tool as WFM software runs in the ungodly expensive numbers. $10-$20/agent is not uncommon, and up to $2,000 per license. I'd say at my level, less than 50% of my time is in Excel, but that's uncommon--I've got a good staff. Most people spend 60% or more in Excel.

I do enjoy it. I love digging into data and it's a lot like a puzzle--where should I hire someone to fill a gap and will it benefit the company enough to justify the costs? Getting a smooth outlook is a great feeling. Then convincing my partners and co-workers/clients that it's a good solution is the other portion of my job (other than coaching my team).
-------------
Investment bankers use excel a lot and start off making 6 figures out of school. Building all those financial models (not too excel intensive, more focus on the actual numbers) 
-------------
Oil and Gas analyst at upstream firm.
-------------
I'm an Acoustic Consultant and use Excel for the ease of processing my small-data sets.
-------------
Student Housing Property Manager here. I'm in excel about 30% of my time to handle all of the operations logistics our Management software can't handle. 
-------------
id imagine most of them are either engineers or some type of finance/accounting positions. 
-------------
Accountant.  Got the perfect industry job. Exceptionally happy at work. 
-------------
I'm an equity portfolio manager at an asset management firm. My processes are built around excel, vba, R, and SQL. SQL for data management, R for data analysis, VBA for report automation, and excel is the glue.

Someone once told me that excel's both greatest strength and greatest weakness is its versatility. It can do anything and everyone in finance uses it.

Here's an example of something I use excel for: every morning I come in and open a spreadsheet that pulls my portfolio's stock positions and cash on hand from an internal website and client contributions/redemptions from a shared drive using a VBA macro. Those two pieces of info combined tell me if I need to buy or sell any ETFs. If I do, my sheet has a table that prepares the trade in the format my firm's trading program needs, so I just copy and paste, then a trader takes care of it.
-------------
When converting USD to local currency, I guess you could see I do earn 100k+...

I build Excel-heavy processes, risk mitigation, system cohesion and automation and data lineage.

i.e. I can make Excel do things no-ones seen before...
-------------
Operations and Systems Manager. I've written a lot of macros for my job so now it's mostly just fixing it when it breaks and creating adhoc reports for VPs of my company. A lot of my job is more problem solving than direct excel work. They bring questions about certain partners or trends or shifts in sales and they want me to provide data for the questions they have. I use Execl as a tool to create the Decks/slides/dashboards.
-------------
I'm not quite at 6 figures, but I'm close. I work in healthcare quality. We analyze patient data for performance and outcomes.

I spend most of my day in excel either analyzing data or creating macros that complete the analysis.

I really like my job. My current degree is in Nursing, but I'm looking at Analytics for my graduate degree.
-------------
I work in Category Management for a very large multinational company. 

I do everything from adhoc reports, to custom macros, to work automation. 

Over six figures. Live and work in the midwest. 6 years of experience with a masters. 
-------------
I've built an incredibly robust quoting system for what I do.  I've picked away at it over the last 12 years and it's gone through a couple total reworks.  Right now to others that see it for the first time, it seems like software.

I don't even remember how I did a lot of stuff and some of the formulas are a mystery unto myself.  But it works very well.
-------------
I'm not sure there are too many jobs that'll pay that much for someone that primarily use Excel. Excel can help you land the jobs that will lead to making 100k+ , but at that point you'll likely be using more specialized software. That's my understanding for analysts, finance may be different.
-------------
I'm a credit manager...I'm responsible for a team of controllers who chase up payments from our customers - most of my day is spent on automation, refining processes to create efficiency, and satisfying the various reporting demands of our major customers. 

There are people with the same job who can barely wrap their head around the SUM function, but they're becoming redundant - I am very comfortable with excel, it's the easiest way for me to reach a solution to most of my problems, from writing a script that automated the sending of 3,000 statements via email every month to hooking into the google maps API to identify duplicate sites in poorly matched data.
-------------
I'm head of local office, client service lead and operations  director for the paid search department of a large global advertising firm. It's way sexier than it sounds. 
-------------
I work within an investment bank, modeling PE investments most of the day.
-------------
Others have said it but investment banking. As an associate I use Excel much less than an analyst would - more of my job is about marshalling resources and managing processes. But a big part of my job is being able to hop into a spreadsheet, understanding what's going on with little to no background and being able to spot and fix issues quickly. My starting salary was 125. We'll see what my all-in is this year; been a fucking grind so I hope I see some returns there.
-------------
Software sales, product advisory, growth marketing, shit... a little bit of everything 
-------------
I'm in key account sales for a big company and I spend a majority of my time in excel.  I love my job but it's really stressful sometimes.
-------------
Pricing, Forecasting & Financial Analysis. I cut and slice a lot in excel, build templates that take the queries I have access to and return processed results, and am in the process of finishing some intricate decision making that should replace the core of my job with a spreadsheet. I find solving problems in Excel to be really fun.

If I need to do heavier number crunching I'll use R (which I'm still learning) and I'm in the process of picking up Tableau as well. But Excel is the workhorse and ultimately the fact that everyone has it makes it really handy.
-------------
Investment banking analyst in an advisory group at a bulge bracket in NYC. Made ~110k my first year (bonus is smaller​ because it's calendar year based and you start mid year). On track to be top or second bucket, so I think it's fair to expect about 130 this year.
-------------
Fp&a manager in Tech industry. 
-------------
Im a purchasing agent for a large automotive manufacturer. Im in excel all day, mostly quote comparisons and planning/reporting. My job wouldn't be possible without it. 

-------------
Private Equity. I hate excel and am glad I am transitioning away from having to do it / engage with it. It's both annoying and a pain in the ass. I prefer telling people how to run the model than actually running it myself. Love my job otherwise.
-------------
I don't but often work alongside people who do (my job is slightly different and I am exteral).

However I often work on regulatory reporting for large financial institutions. I start with SQL Developer to pull and preprocess data from a very large database with all the open transactions. The data gets passed to people who transform it into reports using Excel. The reports keep changing (there is a joke that the max size of an Excel worksheet grows each release to keep ahead of the latest regulatory reporting standards).

Apart from Reg reporting, we have the standard financial analysts/invetment bankers and we also have economists. All consume large quantities of data and regurgitate it using Excel. It works best because of the flexibility.
-------------
I work in HR. People probably think of finance when they think of Excel, but people data is hugely important too.

I love automating complex reports. I've written scripts that interact with our ERP, web browser, outlook, etc. My most recent project was to automate time sheet entry (yes, we still use those). It pulls reports, imports time data, runs comparisons and applies complex rules and calculations to generate an upload into the system. 


-------------
Corporate accountant at a fortune 50 firm - I just make sure I can do more than my managers can google. Keeps 'em amazed. Routinely blow their minds with simple keyboard shortcuts and god forbid I make something in VB. 
-------------
I manage other people's constantly-moving assets.  I spend 99% of my time matching data, creating pivot tables, reporting to stakeholders, suppliers, creditors, creating scenarios for the lay person, etc.  I love it.
-------------
Purchasing & Installation manager here for a robotics company.

I primarily use excel to schedule the workshop production & to track/analysis various forms of data (sales, products, timings, etc)
-------------
I work in digital marketing / e-commerce. A seasoned Excel consultant can make well over $100k simplifying web analytics for middle and upper management, training staff, creating macros, it's endless!
-------------
Pharmaceutical clinical trial supplies:  I use Excel for most of my work with forecasting, planning, issue resolution, etc.  Its crazy because I use Excel as a go around most of the time to circumvent the utterly useless systems our company has spent millions on.   
-------------
Before the pound plummeted, I was on around $100k/year.

I'm a Data Scientist for a large retail bank in the UK. Most of the work I do is actually in SAS, mainly due to the large volumes of data I have to deal with. Excel is basically the icing on the cake, the way of delivering the final bit of information to the end users, who generally aren't that technical.
-------------
Yes, it is. We do small equipment and engineering projects on the lower end to full turnkey (equipment, engineering, construction) projects on the higher end. 

Customers range from single owner operations needing to upgrade a piece of equipment to large conglomerates opening a brand new plant in the middle of nowhere. 
-------------
Not quite at 100K, but it's within the realm of possibility. I'm a Distribution Engineer, although I use the last term loosely and with reservation as I actually have an Engineering Tech degree, and am highly unlikely to get a PE license.

I make a lot of tools and calculators in it that would be be cumbersome to do in Python, and especially if I need to share them with other people.

I also write a lot of macros to clean up other people's shitty Excel files, from all departments - nothing to do with my job, but when someone says, "Can you help me put this data into this file?" and their file looks like garbage, I organize it first before I import a decade's worth of data.
-------------
Director of Sales Tools.  I built a price model that is used to price our products in different markets/regions.  I spend about half my day updating, maintaining, modifying and explaining pricing choices and expectations to the management at each location.
-------------
Not doing it now but... Retail full scale PLM business processes: merchandising, merchandise planning, financial reporting, sourcing, PO creation and management, supply chain\logistics, all the way through promos, price changes, markdowns and clearance.
-------------
Program Manager. I do operations for sales teams and conduct modeling for forecasting, territory management, and data hygiene. I ~~love~~ enjoy it enough for the paycheck.

edit: changed love to enjoy, as I don't love it. 
-------------
 Test Engineer - Midwest - Pushing 6 figures.

Gotta give the dumb design engineers a pretty graph or broken pieces to prove that their stuff doesn't work. 
-------------
Business Consultant with CPA background. I enjoy the challenges associated with the work along with the opportunity to learn how large companies operate. atleast 75% of my time involves excel which can be interesting when new but tedious once learned. 
-------------
I work in business development for a major film studio.  Most of the actual "sleeves up" work is done in excel and is related to modeling out various film and distribution deals, co-financing arrangements, etc.

The type of work is interesting, but I find excel work to be particularly mundane after having been at it for 10 years.  It's the kind of thing where as I move up the ladder I'll be doing less and less of it, but it is still a primary focus of my job. 
-------------
Marketing Data Science  - In terms of skills that I use on a day to day basis - 

50% - SQL (backend code that pre-processes everything else) 
20% - Excel (for simple modeling, and ad-hoc analysis) 
20% - Tableau (for dashboards) 
5% - R  (for stats models) 
5% - Python (for automation)
-------------
And, of course, you must pay attention to lessons learned by http://www.eusprig.org/about.htm

-------------
I do performance audits for the federal government. Work with data from different systems frequently. Use excel for analysis and calculating monetary impacts. Also, use it for making tools to use to manage the team, project milestones, etc. This job does not start over $100k but most of us get here in maybe 7-10 years. 
-------------
Project Controls. Sub disciplines are Cost Engineering, Scheduling and Estimating. Scheduling uses it the least. Typical starting is $60k and you can expect to hit $100k after 5 years if you work for it. Pretty good for a 40 hour work week. 

Major industries are oil and gas, power, utilities, pharmaceuticals. 
-------------
Fashion Buyer/Planner. 

I write all of our company macros and design all our Excel-based tools and templates. Excel skills are what allowed me to climb so rapidly, and grow my salary so quickly (fewer than 5 years experience.)

My degree was in the arts, so this was all what I ended up learning on the fly. 
-------------
Where can I get a job just using Excel and earning 100k a year?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
-------------
Excel is a cancer that most organizations don't realize they have.
-------------
what type of project management? construction?
-------------
>a spreadsheet of my spreadsheets

We have to go deeper
-------------
Project coordinator for a telecom company here! Excel is life. 
-------------
Interesting, I hardly use excel for PM.  I used MS Project but now I use Teamwork and it's fantastic.  Probably the best PM tool I have ever used. 
-------------
Are you PMP certified?
-------------
Project manager here too (Banking, Australia, Agile and PMBOK) I pretty much live in excel and Outlook for the reasons described above.
-------------
Haha... literally slice (with a slicer!) .... I excel.
-------------
What is your actual title? What industry do you work in?
-------------
Same.  I work at a large corporation I'm a regional office full of older people.   I am the go to data guy .  If only they knew how easy pivots and vlookups really were 
-------------
>  it's really good at getting things formatted exactly how you want them (unlike tools such as tableau)

I was going to touch on this in my reply. BI tools are great for quick insights, complex queries, and pretty visuals but nobody is going to be doing any kind of data cleansing in there. Excel owns that job still. 
-------------
> however it really has it's limitations like it you cant efficiently use it with 10 million rows or do any complicated statistics.

I was receiving a file from our users where I had to delete rows based on filters. In a 300K+ row file, I would set a filter then delete those rows, and then walk away and make some tea. Come back and eventually I could set the next filter, delete, repeat.

All said the process took about 2 hours (only had to run it once a month.) I taught myself R and then I created an R script that imported the data, did the necessary filtering/massaging of the data, and spit it back out into a lovely, formatted Excel file. The script ran in 2.5 minutes.
-------------
For 10 million rows, check out the PowerPivot add in!
-------------
just curious - what contractor do you work for? How did you qualify for this job/get the interview?
-------------
I don't believe I answered the question of enjoying it. I will say I've had periods of extreme enjoyment and periods where it felt like I was working in a spreadsheet sweatshop. Find a healthy balance where people respect the craft of spreadsheet development first and foremost as opposed only about the finished product. At the end of the day I would love to train people to use the program and realize it's potential - *shameless self promotion* - http://www.itsnotaboutthecell.com
-------------
What kind of automation and reporting? I do automation and reporting and I'm being paid $22 an hour by a temp agency. I write SQL and open portals to the fourth dimension in Excel. (by write SQL I mean I select the ever loving shit out of things. I never Create/Drop/Update)

I'm thinking about walking away to go teach English overseas though.
-------------
What is your degree in? This position has always intrigued me but I probably picked the wrong major.
-------------
Just be prepared to put in an extra 800 hours of work per year for the first 5-7 years.
-------------
I am actually thinking about getting the license required for this in the US. I am going to finish my Ph.D first in physics but would like the license as a fall back.

Are you in the US and if so does the license require continued education to keep up?
-------------
How do you deal with the 15 digit number precision? I thought this was the biggest issue for most actuarys using Excel. Also, do you define the statistical functions on your own? Because they always say that the standard ones are not that good (but I am not an expert here as well - maybe you could write something about this? :-) ).
-------------
What exactly do actuaries do? I have an accounting degree but am thinking about a career change. 
-------------
Were you prior military? If so, which mos? Do you have a degree? And can you give a general overview of how you use it?

I'm in the army reserves and interested in anything counter terrorism.
-------------
Any examples of any blogs or websites that help explain/teach this? 
-------------
What is your job? Would love a job like that.
-------------
Just curious as a guy in a similar role - what size company? We did for quite some time, but then recently switched to another platform that hooks up with our accounting system and also has great excel exports/ report templates. Used to be in excel 75% of the time, but down to maybe 50% because of sweet sweet automation.
-------------
Same here. Excel and VBA is life!
-------------
As an upcoming business student how did you get into strategic finance? That sounds quite interesting.
-------------
Correct answer. My friend basically works at an investment bank in nyc. Makes ~250K is 24, just uses excel most of the day. but hates his job/life.
-------------
FYI it's only >100k for total comp, and that's ignoring cost of living adjustment (roughly 1.4x greater than national average here in NYC).  Start off salary is $85k salary plus 25k stubbed bonus for first half year.
-------------
Interesting. My company does third party utility billing for property management companies, including student housing.
-------------
Management Consulting as well.
-------------
Engineer here. Use excel 10% of the time
-------------
While I don't do it anymore, I was doing primarily financial modeling for real estate investments.  You could look at it like an offshoot from finance, so you are correct.
-------------
Agreed, in terms of versatility, there is really nothing that compares to excel, which can make it your best friend or greatest enemy!    
I often describe excel as the greatest "sand box" tool out there for decision making....just don't use that sand box to build a f*%^ing skyscraper!  ;)

-------------
Why R over Python?
-------------
My motto has always been: "invest enough time into it and excel can do literally anything"   
  
I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the first sentient AI comes out of excel. 
-------------
Sound like something I was IMed in the past: "This Excel does weird stuff but whoever built it is a genius tho." That was a chuckle.
-------------
Actuary here. Every actuary I know uses Excel most of the day. Mid 100s even in Midwest COL.
-------------
Well, to be fair to OP the question was "work in Excel most of the day" as opposed to "Primarily uses Excel". 

I have Excel open all the time and I'd be working from/in it most of the day. It would be true however that Outlook is where I actually live all day.
-------------
You are pretty far off base on this one. Every IB analyst and associate is heavily in excel and PowerPoint. Every FPnA group in any size company is using excel. 

Yes we also have specialized programs like essbase, but guess what, it interfaces through excel.


I work in strategy and I would say my time is about 1/3rd excel 1/3rd PowerPoint and 1/3rd meetings, clear over $250k a year.
-------------
Yep.  One of my early jobs was as a statistical analyst where I used Lotus 123 , Quatro Pro and eventually Excel.  I mostly do IT consulting now for a huge company. 

Being good with Excel is just one of the arrows in my quiver.  It allows me to do one time  analysis quickly but I usually look to port solutions to a database with a web frontend if it's going to be something others are going to use.  Right tool for the job is important.
-------------
Investment banking. My friends in structured finance clear $120k in base and they're VBA experts. 
-------------
I think your misperception is based on how you interpreted the question. The question wasn't "can you make 6 figures just by knowing excel," the question was about 6 figure jobs that use excel.
-------------
Banking and consulting are both careers with above 100k salaries often for entry level positions, and both use excek extensively.
-------------
Sponsors coverage at SunTrust?

Edit: never mind. You say you work for a TIMO... unless you made a job change in the past months. 
-------------
Keep charging up that hill.
-------------
does it require a CPA?!  i am just a regular bachelor in adminstration graduated with 2.7 GPA.... but would like a cushy job working in excel internal reporting !

Only if you want to perform excel-ception. 

Or is it if you want to pimp yo spreadsheets?
-------------
Sheetception
-------------
We use Primavera for scheduling (similar to MS project) and a customized Oracle program for tracking equipment requisition and purchasing, but I use excel to track everything other imaginable part of a project...invoicing, change orders, customer communications and issues, change orders, etc. 


-------------
That sounds interesting...I'm going to look into Teamwork as I'm always looking for better tools to use. 
-------------
Yes, PMP certified, although my company does not execute the "PMP way" which is why other PMs may run their projects differently. Not ideal, but our manager is very hands off and let's us run our projects like a mini-business how we see fit (as long as we don't screw up too badly). 
-------------
Outlook is the bane of my existence. Some things it does are so convoluted and don't work well (searching, filing emails). But one of the programs we must use.

Sorry...I won't give you my title. Not sure I want that info on reddit. I've moved up steadily throughout my career. Started as a staff accountant, got my MBA/ MSA, was promoted several times.

Unless someone breaks a badly referenced set of sheets. Than is a nightmare
-------------
What do you mean by data cleansing?
-------------
Excel naturally has a higher human element factor to it and allows you to "feel" the data more  (and to micro manage).... however it is not practical for very large data sets.... R will do amazing data cleaning... but it's harder to understand and to explore. Tableau is a fantastic tool for exploratory data analysis.....

Excel in general is very close to the earth and allows one to develop a very good intuition about data and errors... it simply does not scale well for large data sets...
-------------
data.table package in R will do this in about 30 seconds it's processing is more efficient than dplyr but it's syntax is more confusing (base  R will take like 15 minutes min if you have enough ram) . Tableau will do this in a minute or so....   Excel will just sit there and cry.....  
-------------
I'll shoot you the company I work for in a PM (don't mind giving it out but don't want there to be any perceived conflation between them and my online actions/opinions).

As for qualifying and interviewing:  BS and MS in aerospace engineering.  My position requires an MS (though we have 2-3 year term positions for folks with only a BS).  I got the interview by applying to a few openings posted on the website, then bugging them when I hadn't heard back in a month.

I actually didn't know this company existed until an alumni who works here have a talk to my grad school program, dip I kind of lucked into this.  I think I can count on one hand how often I've used the things I studied in undergrad and grad school.  Did a lot of learning on the job, both about the tools I use and the kind of work I do.  Thankfully a lot of it makes sense if you work through it logically and my company lacks a ton of formal research, modeling, or simulation processes because pour projects can all be so unique.
-------------
Buddy of mine is actually over in Bali teaching English online through [VIPKID](https://t.vipkid.com.cn/?refereeId=2302993)- I've never heard of it but he's going on strong for probably 2+ years now and last time we hung out he certainly didn't look poor so the checks must be steady.  In terms of what I do - Fortune 50 company that has a presence in the online banking market - a lot of outdated processes still leveraging Office products - Excel, Access, PowerPoint - so often times I'm plugging holes in the boat as they transition to a .NET framework. As someone who started out with Excel as a visualization tool to now making it do ridiculous stuff to the point of job elimination - I really try to warn people that automation is not a "futuristic" idea - it's here and it's now. One of the recent items I automated that I'm proposing could effectively eliminate 19 jobs. I will say as an Excel developer - Power BI takes my 5+ years of day in day out experience and wipes the slate clean that anyone could pick up and do on day one. Exciting time for Microsoft but make sure you're well rounded is my best advice.
-------------
Probably a supply chain major. That's what I have as well. 
-------------
You don't need a degree to get into Supply Chain Management, it's one of those careers you can work your way up in. Depending on your country there are professional bodies such as CIPS (Chartered Institute of Purchasing & Supply).
-------------
Business but I didn't specialize in supply chain and most of the people I have worked with over the years didn't specifically major in supply chain either.  It tends to draw analytical problem solvers from all walks of life and backgrounds.
-------------
Unless your in consulting I strongly disagree. If you don't count studying for exams it's rare that I work 40 hours in a week, let alone more than that.
-------------
In a non-consulting role I put in less than 40 for most of the year. Maybe a few extra hours here and there for crunch time but overall not bad at all.
-------------
And if you don't take the tests in college...creating time to study for them is real shit show if you want to have a life. I was a math major who got and MBA, then got a job, then took the probability test, then gave up. But I still make 6 figures, so it's all good. 
-------------
That's a conservative estimate. The expectation is an extra 800 hours a week. 
-------------
It's not really that type of license. There can be 7-10 pretty arduous exams which require hundreds of study hours each (less for some of the beginning ones depending on your math/stat knoweledge).
-------------
Actuaries manage risk for insurance companies. They generally work in one of the 3 major job functions. Pricing, reserving, and modeling. Pricing is essentially figuring out what to charge for insurance risks and then file those rates with the regulators at the state levels. Actuaries set broad pricing goals/parameters and underwriters apply those to individuals policies. Reserving is making sure insurance companies hold enough capital in reserves to pay future claims by predicting claims dollars that hasn't been reported or paid yet. The law requires a credentialed actuary to sign off on rate filings and reserve estimates. Modeling includes predictive modeling, economic capital modeling, catastrophe modeling, dynamic financial analysis, and other stuff. Some companies have actuaries do modeling work and some companies have data scientists, statisticians, and or business analysts do it. So depend on where you work at, the job opportunities may be different. Outside of those 3 main areas, many actuaries work in non traditional roles like investments, capital markets, hedging, etc.

Negative, not prior military, by I do work with quite a few (mostly 35s but a few others). Started out doing risk analysis after college (how likely will it be that a plane hits our building...0.000001% dumbass), ended up in Intel. Had a strong IT/excel/access/vba background. Realized I could do the work of 100 analysts with these skills, marketed that, the right people found me. FWIW, the FBI had a few data analyst positions posted recently, prob not quite 100k, but not far off (GS11-13 I think). It's a hot skill that is desperately need in the IC at the moment.

Edit: You asked how I use it...well, speaking very broadly....as you probably know, the IC is just database, and search tool over and over again. The traditional MO was "find the bad guys. 100 analyst proceeded to comb through these systems over months. I said. "Probably can't tell you exactly who the bad guy is, but I can give a top x most likely in a fraction of the time. Once you've cut out 99.9% of the onsey-twosey searching, you realize you can start getting proactive, which in turn make the decision makers happy when they can report great stats.

Not sure... though just perhaps reading a lot more on pop economics and stats might help you. r/dataisugly , r/dataisbeautiful are also nice places.

We actually had better systems when we were on our own. Got bought out by a larger company and regressed back to Excel.

Which platform did you incorporate?
-------------
A lot of general business classes - good foundation of finance (don't need investments) and accounting and how the business operations link to the dollars. Plenty of jobs out there - it's not as sexy or well compensated as investment banking, but the hours will likely be better (mine aren't) and you'll really get to know the company you work for - you'll get both the 50,00 foot view and the ground view- and how a business is run. 
-------------
What the other guy responded to you is pretty accurate. You have to know and understand the whole business. 

I have a marketing degree in undergrad with an MBA with finance concentration. I worked in sales, then accounting, then FP&A. 

You have to have a strong FP&A background, be good at building out financial models, and have a strong personality to be able to work with different departmental managers. 

Not a lot of companies have strategic finance but it's definitely a growing trend.

There's people making that much in Atlanta or charlotte. The signing bonuses can be hefty too 
-------------
That's what the guys above me have used forever. We've looked at Python a bit and it looks great with stuff like numpy and pandas, but even if it may be a little bit faster for what we do, we can just throw more computers at most problems.

That said, when I peek at job postings and see Python experience wanted, I get a twang of concern that I should be learning it on my own. But I think if I ever switched to a similar role at another firm that used Python instead of R, they're similar enough that I could bring myself up to speed quickly with a lot of upfront effort.
-------------
I think the point is that you're also using more than just excel. Sure, 80% of my work is in excel, but we also have modeling software that is used for the serious number crunching that you would need to learn.
-------------
Presumably your salary is because you know how to actuary. Excel is a tool, not the underlying knowledge.

A good analogy is likely that CAD software knowledge can get you a job as a mechanical designer. You may be a CAD wizard but that doesn't mean you've studied the engineering that goes into all the engineering decisions. CAD knowledge alone won't get you an engineer role, just as Excel knowledge won't get you an actuary role.
-------------
Are you hiring?

Structured finance isn't investment banking. It's global markets (sales and trading in each bank's FICC group). 

Investment banking is also excel and PowerPoint heavy for coverage teams (depending on sector you may do more iterations of modeling than pitching). Product teams a bit less modeling intensive. 

Edit:  looks like he might be referring to the asset backed financing group in the IBD over there in which case your friend is right. Just doesn't go by structured finance at most places as that typically refers to the markets teams structuring CDO's at most shops.

I wouldn't lead with that on your applications. In any case you don't need a CPA if you aren't signing on tax documents (I don't think; I don't know all the nuances though).

Someone with advanced Macros experience who can automate various reports and offer optimization advice.

Are these just basic sheets? I guess the question I'm really asking is if there are any templates you've created that you'd be willing to share. I'm in manufacturing PM and involved in a lot of similar activities and just looking for any improvements I can make.

As a secondary follow-up I see in another comment that you said you are PMP certified. Did you find it worth it- considering going that route too.

I was referring to the exams
-------------
I'm in the UK, I came out of uni having gained exemptions from 7 actuarial exams (out of about 13 required). I actually wished I'd passed fewer, as the later professional exams are absolutely insane in terms of workload. It would have been nice to have a few easier starter professional exams instead of going straight into CA1 (shudder).
-------------
Are all 10 exams required to enter the field, or is it one of those environments where you build up and take them as you increase mastery?
-------------
IC = intelligence community?  I've had an interest in working in that field.  Sounds like I could be a great fit.

I knew it was IT, only they have the best paying jobs
-------------
similar size here, we were almost the opposite. we ran off a 20 mb excel file that was passed around, then acquired a company which used SAP sitting on an oracle database (jesus christ it was expensive), found a happy medium in a cheaper cloud platform.
-------------
adaptiveinsights. easy to use, not expensive at all, very robust excel/ office integration. not a full ERP, but also doesn't need a dozen people to keep running.
-------------
Ya in DFW an IB salary can come in at +$100k base right out of undergrad. 
-------------
Signing is $10k and pretty standard street wide. Atlanta and Charlotte are paying that because the boutiques and regionals are shit at attracting target school talent like NYC so they pay NYC level salaries for analysts with shit trajectory on comp at the associate and VP spots. 

I'm my desk's recruitment liaison with HR unfortunately.
-------------
I'm not specifically, but the company is always hiring.
-------------
Sales and trading is a component of what my pals over at GS do. They're not classical investment bankers (what I consider M&A), but structuring CMBS notes certainly is considered investment banking (by GS at least). 
-------------
I'm sorry I made some pretty universal generalizations. My friends, who happen to be investment bankers at Goldman Sachs, are extremely good at VBA. 

Those specific people meet the criteria that OP asked for. I am not implying that you need to know VBA to be a banker. 


-------------
A TIMO is not an investment bank fyi
-------------
you can't sign audit either, but i am not interested in this xD

still do you think internal reporting can be a cushy job?!  35h/week, not much overtime good pay?! no super deadline and stress?
-------------
I do this as an inventory manager (automate E-Commerce inventory mgmt so it syncs with AS400 company system with Excel macros). And of course automating and running reports just as you would with any csv data exports. I'd listen to offers, but it's really seen as a luxury/nice to have from what I've seen so far.

where do you work, send me a PM...i work in Dallas and pretty savvy at Excel (vloopup, pivot tables, etc.) basic Access queries, and Spotfire.
-------------
I'm in Dallas and looking. This is my real name too. Manage inventory for 80K skus and automate E-Comm
Inventory all in Excel through macros and a network of nested conditional formulas. I'd do something more analytical/problem solving oriented for a deal <100k.

Some worksheets are basic. Others are linked to other data such as steel manufacturing progress. They're all custom made by me and sometimes I'll change the structure of them based on my needs at the time (can't anticipate everything!). 

As for PMP certification, I would say it's worth it for my projects, even though not required in my company. The knowledge learned is just another tool that I can choose to use or not, since it's required by my company. The certification itself honestly is only worth something to add to my resume. 

I'm traveling until tomorrow but I'll see what spreadsheets I have that I can share as templates. Again I customized them specifically for my needs, so you may or may not find them of any use.

What engineering degree? I know a lot of engineers in supply chain, mostly industrial engineers. 

In my career I have done sourcing, new product development, purchasing, supply chain planning and analytics (most excel heavy job by far). 

The planning and analytics role was a lot of supply chain cost modeling, data analysis/dashboards/reporting, SQL programming, supply chain network modeling and optimization.

Now I work as a Lean Healthcare consultant so I don't use excel nearly as much as I used to since my work is much more collaborative and hands on these days. 
-------------
Ohh sure sure sure. Still paid study time helps for a chunk of it!
-------------
Usually people get their first actuarial job with 2-3 already passed. And then once they're in the company usually pays for study material/the exams and provides studying time. 

There are different tracks (health/life/property casualty), and each has its own requirements. For the health track you get your first credential after 5 exams (Associate of the Society of Actuaries) and then your second after 3 more (Fellow of the Society of Actuaries).

If you're considering it there's an actuarial subreddit (/r/actuary) with a general FAQ.
-------------
Not anymore. The market is changing.

Dallas is Awesome. I have a decent amount of coworkers from my analyst class in Dallas and it's fun to visit them

I wouldn't call BAML a boutique or regional, but ok 
-------------
Y'all got any more of them Charlotte/Atlanta jobs?
-------------
No it's really not.  Structurally it resides in the Securities division. At DB it's in the Global Markets group. GS literally has a separate group called IBD. We call ours Corp Fin. Private side is the traditional investment bank. Markets groups structurally and for regulatory reasons are segregated in the broker-dealer legal entity. 

We say we work at an investment bank to the layman because sure it's the closest point of reference someone not in the industry will grasp. 
-------------
You're correct, sadly it is scene as a luxury instead of an absolute necessity. 

Mmm I would think about focusing on the Amazon Sellers community. 

Amazon is the new gold rush for entrepreneurial America. Outside of the main tools like channel advisor which those starting out can't afford there could be a solid niche market for you there.

My best advise, whenever you meet anyone in ecomm or whatever field, just ask them "whose your data champion?" After they crumble and fall, look them dead in the eye and tell them "I'm your fucking data champion."

Why do you add two Ms? Couldn't you just represent $200 million as $200M?

Thanks for the reply. I'd like to think I'm fairly competent at excel and I use it very heavily, It's just sometimes I find myself in a feedback loop trying to perfect a sheet or workbook, or find that perfect way to automate the data highlights I'm looking for- then at the end of it I feel like I wasted too much time and probably should have found a more analog solution if that makes sense. That was a run-on and I'm not proud, but I'm not going to invest time into fixing it (see above).

Thanks again.
-------------
...One Note?
-------------
Thanks this is helpful. I have a Mining Engineering degree. Lot of excel  and python experience. We develop schedules and cost estimates for long and short term planning needs (equipment, manpower). I have enjoyed developing contracts and negotiating on prices for services and product orders. Not too sure how much of an overlap there is.

Dude this guy works for DB in NYC he knows more than us 
-------------
BAML primary recruitment is NYC based. Charlotte largest presence of IBD teams handles industrials. Aside from that they mostly focus on whole loan markets and corp management. 

The product teams are almost entirely in NYC with some support out of Charlotte in comparable capacity to the support DB gets from its Jacksonville investment banking team (20-30 people in Jax from tier 2 recruiting)
-------------
I don't work in Atlanta or Charlotte. But being the vp on my desk that's primary point of contact for recruiting means I need to know the overall market. 

Try SunTrust though. 
-------------
PM me if you're actually serious. I could maybe move a resume for you in charlotte 
-------------
I guess we can keep arguing something that's not super important. But Goldman's IBD group includes M&A and Financing. At GS Structured Finance is a sub group under Financing.

But idk maybe I don't understand because I'm not a fancy banker. 






-------------
200M represents 200 mille or 200,000. 200MM represents 200 mille mille, or 200,000,000.  
-------------
M in this context means thousand.  A million is a thousand thousand.  Generally people will stick to a convention, so M to their company will always mean thousand.    
-------------
Sounds like quite a bit of overlap for a purchasing/procurement supply chain role. 
-------------
True, but they still have a bunch of lev fin, syndications, and asset backed gigs in charlotte. 

Not quite the same as up in NYC, but pretty good for going to a local SEC school and networking in. 
-------------
Unless you're talking about the asset finance group in investment banking there (which issues ABL debt for corporate clients secured against specific collateral) then your friend is in the broker dealer. 
-------------
Which is dumb.
-------------
"k" is thousand, "M" is million o.O

MM = million millions... I only saw it in weird MMO games
-------------
See my comment comparison about DB equivalent in Jax. 

Also asset backed is markets, not IBD. 
-------------
We should probably tell Goldman that their [website](http://www.goldmansachs.com/what-we-do/investment-banking/services/financing.html) is incorrect. Issuing debt securities on a primary market is the fixed income equivalent of an IPO. I don't think it is right say only M&A is investment banking. 



-------------
[There's much to be said for established standards](https://xkcd.com/927/).
-------------
In roman numerals, M is thousand.  
-------------
For fuels people, M is thousand and MM is millions 
-------------
Dollars aren't metric :/
-------------
You didn't see my edit. I saw that. It's an asset financing group (AFG). GS feels like calling it different than the rest of the street apparently. 

Structured finance teams are the common term for securitization desks in markets originating and trading CDO's. You won't find any other groups than GS conflating the two (and yes GS also has a structured finance team in securities focused on securitization too)
