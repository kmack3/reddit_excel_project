Excel auto solve function for finding different values
I am trying to give excel a range of numbers and have it tell me which 2 (or 3) numbers, when put together, equal another number. I believe there is a way to do this but haven't been able to find clear guidance. If anyone can ELI5 or point me to a layman explanation on YouTube of how to do this, I would appreciate it.

This is a problem for Solver, an Excel-add in. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4RJcedcO-0) the exact problem you're trying to solve on YouTube.

You may need to [enable Solver](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Load-the-Solver-Add-in-612926fc-d53b-46b4-872c-e24772f078ca) if you've never used it before.
