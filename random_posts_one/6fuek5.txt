I want to auto generate file name and save it into the correct folder from one button.
I have managed to get the file to auto generate the name from another post of this sub. My code looks like this

Sub Button10_Click()

ChDir "chosen directory"

Application.GetSaveAsFilename Range("AC1")

End Sub

Which saves it with the correct name and prompts me to pick the right folder. I am wondering if there is a way to pick the folder from another cell in the excel file. We have job numbers so there is a job number on the sheet and a folder with the same name on our server. I am also struggling to get it to chose any place on the server to save to.

This is what it looks like when I copy the file path of the folder where I want to to be saved but it keeps just prompting me to save it in my documents."\\servername\folder\subfolder\subfolder" What am I doing wrong?



-------------
network locations need a double backslash and you'll need one on the end of the string before your filename.

    "\\servername\folder\subfolder\subfolder\"

edit: you can use two cells to reference the full file path with a simple & concatenator.

    "\\server\file\" & "filename.xlsx"

I did use a double backslash, not sure why it didn't show that on my post. Still could not get it to work. So could I use "\\server\file\" & "AC1"? Would that make it choose the right folder on the server?

Ah, backslash is an escape character. Mine shows because it's in a code block. Forgot about that sorry.

If the above was in a cell and it resolves to the correct path, then yeah it should work. If it's in code though you'll need something more to let Excel know AC1 is a range.

    "\\filepath\" & Range("AC1").Value
