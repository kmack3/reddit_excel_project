Command regarding currency and the worksheet
Is there a command or a setting that detects currency type on one worksheet and change it accordingly on the other worksheet?

For example, let's say that I have company's financial statements uploaded on one sheet in Euros, is there any way for excel sheet to detect it and change the analysis page to have that same currency?
