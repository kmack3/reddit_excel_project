AVERAGEIF for visible rows only
https://i.gyazo.com/2a47fd1b810edc43...cac4f2d256.png

I want to set up a function which can average, for example, all the durations corresponding to zone "D1", but ignoring any hidden rows which include times for zone "D1".

AVERAGEIF doesn't work because it includes hidden rows, and SUBTOTAL doesn't have an option for AVERAGEIF.

Would appreciate some advice?

Cheers

You can use SUBTOTAL in a helper column that will count the cell with the SUBTOTAL in it, and then AVERAGEIFS including the condition that the corresponding SUBTOTAL is 1.

    =SUMPRODUCT(SUBTOTAL(109,INDIRECT("b"&ROW(B2:B5000)))*(A2:A5000="d1"))/SUMPRODUCT(SUBTOTAL(102,INDIRECT("b"&ROW(B2:B5000)))*(A2:A5000="d1"))

I made it arbitrarily cut off at row 5000 just for performance reasons, but you can expand or shorten as needed.

Essentially: sumproduct a subtotal sum of all visible numbers where A:A = zone "D1", and divide that by sumproduct a subtotal count of all visible numbers were A:A = Zone "D1". Of course you can make "D1" a reference to another cell instead of the string.

Edit: I realize that explanation was actually wrong. What I should've said is that the subtotal sum with the offset creates an array of a subtotal sum of *each* row, one by one. So a subtotal sum of cell B2, a subtotal sum of cell B3, a subtotal sum of B4, etc. So if it's a hidden row then the sum of that cell will be =0 no matter what the actual value in the cell is. And then I take that value and multiply it by 1 or 0, depending if A:A = "D1" or not and then add up the array [ie the sumproduct]. Then rinse and repeat for a subtotal counta.

Can you repost the screenshot? Use www.imgur.com, it's much better.

`AGGREGATE` has some tricks up its sleeves, like try the same `SUBTOTAL` formula but do `1/1/formula*(zone="C")` to generate errors when it's not equal to "C", and turn on the ignore errors flag.

But I think a helper column might be the only way if that doesn't work.

This was spot on, thank you so much!

I just use gyazo for time-saving :-)

Glad to hear it helped! If you don't mind, could you reply to my original post with "Solution Verified"? Thanks!
