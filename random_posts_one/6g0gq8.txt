Novice wanting to put together a simple drop down list.
Hello, and thank you ahead of time if you're reading this. I'm looking for a simple drop down menu, I've looked at tutorials for dynamic drop down lists and I'm not sure if that's what I should be going with. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/3pzly) is a screenshot of what I'm working with. 

This will be a list to easily look up fixture weights by department. A2 to A7 are all department tags, I want to be able to add in fixtures with the department tags and their weights as they are given to me on a day to day basis, and have a user be able to pick the department from the drop down to easily find the fixture they are looking for. Sorry if this is ramble-y, I'm sure this has been brought up a lot on here but I would really appreciate the help.

Thank you!

I believe you'll need to do the Sol-Verf by its self for Clippy to pick it up. But I'm glad it worked out!
