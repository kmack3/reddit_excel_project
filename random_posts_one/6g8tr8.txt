Using INDEX MATCH MATCH to display information next to pivot table. How do I get display to expand/contract as Pivot table changes length?

My spreadsheet is tracking ~150 applicants for a variety of tutoring positions.  I have a main worksheet tracking every applicant, logging relevant information from initial application through hiring decision (first image).  I then have subject specific worksheets breaking out applicants who could cover that adacemic subject (second image).  I'm using a small pivot table on the subject specific sheets, that take the appropriate candidates off the master list and displays them on the bottom half of the subject sheet.  I'm then using INDEX MATCH MATCH to pull other relevant information about the applicant and display next to the pivot table.  

My problem is, as the applicant pool grows with new applications, and shrinks with hiring decisions, I need to keep manually adjusting the INDEX MATCH MATCH field. (See bottom of second image).  Is there a way to have it keep up automatically?

You can either embed an auto-update macro in the sheet which will populate the cells for each additional line (right click the sheet and view code, write code), or just extend the INDEX MATCH to the max possible value but to make the cells blank, insert the IFERROR/IFNA function, kinda like this:

    =IFERROR(INDEX([value],MATCH([value])),"")

It should return blanks for all the non-values.
