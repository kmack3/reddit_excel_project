Repeating Blank Rows from Specific Cell Value in VBA
I'd like to repeat a blank row X times based on a cell's (G1) value then copy the repeated rows with Cells (A1 to F1).

I've been digging around to find a solution and found something that inserts 1 row above each. Can someone help complete?

Sub BlankLine()

    Dim Col As Variant
    Dim BlankRows As Long
    Dim LastRow As Long
    Dim R As Long
    Dim StartRow As Long
    Dim RepeatR As Variant
    
        Col = "G"
        StartRow = 1
        BlankRows = 1
        RepeatR = "G1"
        
            LastRow = Cells(Rows.Count, Col).End(xlUp).Row
        
            Application.ScreenUpdating = False

            With ActiveSheet
            
    
    For R = LastRow To StartRow + 1 Step -1
    If .Cells(R, Col) > "0" Then
    .Cells(R, Col).EntireRow.Insert Shift:=xlUp
    End If
    Next R
    End With
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    
    End Sub

Edit: codeformatting



-------------
To apply code formatting

    Use 4 spaces to start each line

You can select code in your VBA window, press Tab, then copy and paste into your thread or comment.

You can try the following


    Sub BlankLine()
        Dim Col As Variant
        Dim BlankRows As Long
        Dim LastRow As Long
        Dim R As Long
        Dim StartRow As Long
    
        Col = "G"
        StartRow = 1
        BlankRows = 1
    
        LastRow = ActiveSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, Col).End(xlUp).Row
        Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
        For R = LastRow To StartRow + 1 Step -1
            If ActiveSheet.Cells(R, Col) > 0 Then
            For i = 1 To ActiveSheet.Cells(R, Col).Value
                ActiveSheet.Cells(R, Col).EntireRow.Insert Shift:=xlDown
            Next i
            End If
        Next R
    
            Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    End Sub

-------------
> For i = 1 To ActiveSheet.Cells(R, Col).Value
>             ActiveSheet.Cells(R, Col).EntireRow.Insert Shift:=xlDown
>         Next i
>         End If

SOLUTION VERIFIED!

All I need now is to do some lines with Copy to repeat the content. thanks!
