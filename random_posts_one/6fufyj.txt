Issue with chart templates, new graphs dont actually copy the template.
I'm making a template for my graphs to minimize time spent formatting them to be the same. It's a super basic XY chart, but for some reason my template doesn't actually build new charts to look like my original. Screenshots here of what I am going for and the data, and what happens when I try to make a new one.

Ive tried both selecting the entire data section, as well as only the series data, and the chart still comes out wrong. Am I doing something wrong here? I have to imagine there is a way for my template to actually make the graph I want somehow...

Follow up details - 

It appears that there are 3 things that are not applying to my newly made charts:

1) Not recognizing my first column as the y-axis data

2) Not keeping my axis titles

3) Not keeping the original chart size

Is there something that I can do to ensure these things are also applied to my new charts?
