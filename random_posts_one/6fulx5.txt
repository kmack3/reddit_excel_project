VBA Question: how to use the same variable (GetOpenFileName) across multiple subs ?
Hello everyone,

Need some help in how to declare a variable at module level to be able to use it in multiple subs.

The variable in question is a workbook that the user browses for through GetOpenFileName. Thanks in advance.

Example code:

    Sub GetFile()
    
    Dim fNameAndPath As Variant
    
    fNameAndPath = Application.GetOpenFilename(FileFilter:="Excel Files (*.XLS), *.XLS", Title:="Select File To Be Opened")
    If fNameAndPath = False Then Exit Sub
    
        Call one
        Call two
        
    End Sub
    
    Sub one()
    
        With fNameAndPath
        
            'do stuff
            
        End With
    
    End Sub
    
    Sub two()
    
        With fNameAndPath
        
            'do stuff
            
        End With
    
    End Sub



-------------
You need to declare it above `Sub GetFile()`. I'd also recommend declaring it as a string rather than a variant.

    Dim fNameAndPath as string
    Sub GetFile()
        'things
    End Sub

    Sub one()
        'other things
    End Sub

Thanks for the reply. Tried it but didn't seem to work. Managed to find something else which seems to work fine:

    Sub GetFile()
    
    Dim fNameAndPath As Variant
    
    fNameAndPath = Application.GetOpenFilename(FileFilter:="Excel Files (*.xlsx), *.xlsx", Title:="Select File To Be Opened")
    If fNameAndPath = False Then Exit Sub
    
    one fNameAndPath
    two fNameAndPath
    three fNameAndPath
    
    
    End Sub
    
    Sub one(fNameAndPath As Variant)
    
        Range("A1") = 1
    
    End Sub
    
    Sub two(fNameAndPath As Variant)
    
        Range("B1") = 2
    
    End Sub
    
    Sub three(fNameAndPath As Variant)
    
        Range("D1:H1") = 2
    
    End Sub

SOLUTION VERIFIED!

yep, because you can't declare DIM outside of a method. You declare `Public fNameAndPath as whateverYouNeed`, you can use more types though; start from the basics.

Nice work. There are many ways to skin the proverbial cat in programming. Glad you found something that worked for you.

Yes you can.

Never been able on Excel 2010, tried that in 2016 and it actually works.

This article talks about variable scope. I was able to do it in 2010 and the article doesn't mention not being able to do it previously. Perhaps there was a particular place you couldn't do it previously, like in a worksheet object or something?

Maybe. I don't have 2010 anymore, it was a bool flag that I needed globally.
I know about scope etc, and that's why I was shocked to not be able to DIM there :S while public and private was working.
