Finding months from start date to week ending date
I have data that includes start date and week ending date for clock ins. I tried using datedif(start,end,"m") but it is not working for some reason. Gaps where it shows that people worked for no hours or for way too many. I just want to see how many hours by month since start date

I would check your start date and end date to ensure they are a number format - =ISNUMBER() and that they are not being stored as text. Otherwise =DATEDIF(A1,B1,"m") - worked fine for me just now in Excel 2016.
