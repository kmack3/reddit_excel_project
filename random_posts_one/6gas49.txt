How to show pacing over 100% in donut chart
I want to use a donut chart to show where I'm pacing towards a goal. Currently, I'm pacing to finish at 119% so my two cells for the graph shows 119% and -19%. This is causing the graph to look like I"m pacing behind.  I can delete the -19% cell, but I'm not always pacing ahead and would rather not have to change the cells/chart each day. 

Anything I can do to make the chart show I'm pacing to 100% without having to manually adjust the excel sheet if I'm over 100%

In your formula for the pacing, you should use 
`=MIN(formula,1)`

This will return a maximum of 1 (100%) 

Then your other cell in the graph should just be `=1-FirstCell`
