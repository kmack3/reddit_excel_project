Combine two rows using OFFSET
Folks,

I've tried to rearrange the OFFSET formula (linked below) to fit my situation but I may be trying to use the wrong tool for the wrong job.

I'm trying to combine each second row into a single row. For example, I'd like row 2 and 3 combined into a single row. You can see that they can be linked by their shared gameorder and gameid in the example from the first few rows of ~10,000.

Any help in achieving this is appreciated.

Thanks

Huh, seems like `COLUMN(A:A)` needs to be `(COLUMN(A:A)-1)`.

Assuming you have 16 columns:

    =OFFSET($A$2,(ROW(1:1)-1)*2+INT((COLUMN(A:A)-1)/16),MOD(COLUMN(A:A)-1,16))

Or this might be easier

    =OFFSET($A$2,(ROW(1:1)-1)*2+INT((COLUMN(A:A)-1)/COLUMN($P:$P)),MOD(COLUMN(A:A)-1,COLUMN($P:$P)))

Right, thank you. That fixed that after I adjusted it to start on A3 and have 24 columns. BUT I've realized I haven't thought this far enough through. 

When I've moved that data across I also want each second line to be deleted so I end up with a dataset that has double the columns but half the rows. Put another way, my end game here is a single row for each unique *gameid*.

In that case, is OFFSET the easiest approach?

If you're looking to delete rows, then do the offset, copy and paste as values, then go delete your source data. 

But then again if you're okay with deleting source data, there's no need for a formula. Just make a new column, `=MOD(ROW(A1),2)` and sort by gameid then by the new column, copy the top half (the 0's), paste next to the 2nd half (the 1's).

......and we're there. Solution Verified.
