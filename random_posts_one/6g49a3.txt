Matching Values from One Table to Another (so that if you type in a value in a different table it automatically fills in the info from original table)
Hi so. Title kinda says it but I'm having trouble describing. Basically, imagine table one:

Column A = Protocol

Column B = ID

So:

Protocol 1 = ID a

Protocol 2 = ID b

Protocol 3 = ID c

And so we have this giant list that goes on and on. 

Now I have a second table, where these protocols are repeated multiple times through thousands of rows. Is there anyway that I can have excel match the values from the first table? So in the new table when I have "Protocol 2" it will automatically pull up "ID b" etc?

Thanks friends

Sure - vlookup - but both files have to be open.
