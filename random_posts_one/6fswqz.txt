Random Sample Excel, help
In sheet 1, I have a list of 10,000 customers and their relevent data.

In sheet 2, I'd like to create a summary. However, I would like to create a cell where the end user can input a number.  Say 2,000.

And it will select a random two thousand rows amongst that 10,000

and return summary statistics.

is this possible?

Not sure what all statistics you want, but here's how you would start the setup.

1. Create a helper field near data to hold random seed. Formula in this column (I'll assume this is col D) is `=RAND()
2. Create a 2nd Helper field, which will rank the seeds. Formula here is `=RANK(D$1:D$10000, D1)
3. Now, when user types in a number N, you can fetch all the records from 2nd helper column that are <= N. Can do this using either Advanced filter, SUMIF criteria, COUNTIF criteria, INDEX/MATCH array, etc. At this point, just depends what type of calculations you want.
