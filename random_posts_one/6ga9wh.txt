Work Scheduling Program?
anyone have advice for a program that could put multiple people on a shift spread out evenly but also take into account the availability of the schedules? Like if Joe couldn't work tuesdays and Sally every other wednesday it could design a schedule around that...?


-------------
Will their availabilities change? Or will Joe never be able to work on Tuesdays? In other words, would you need to alter people's availabilities on a weekly basis and then have the spreadsheet generate the schedule? 
-------------
so we usually make a schedule for the whole semester. So with classes and extracurriculars he probably never works tuesdays, but he also may not be able to work on a wednesday one week randomly. So i would have to input a whole lot in there of conflicts.
