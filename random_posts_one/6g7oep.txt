What I need to do is after I've selected all the items, I wanna be able to press a button to generate a full list of what items i need with the total amount on the second sheet. I really don't know what to google to actually do that so I've been stuck at a wall now for a while. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 

Edit: to clarify a little. What I want to do is

If an item has a quantity of 1 or over. Add it two a master list on the second sheet as well as a grand total at the bottom.


-------------
Power query over each subtable keeping only the entries where the qty column is filled.

Legit sounds completely alien to me haha could you elaborate a little?
