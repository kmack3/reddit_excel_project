Combining data sets and matching/ sorting data for individuals that don't already line up
I am trying to extract a few variables from several workbooks from the same big data study. My issue is that not every workbook has the same individuals and for some reason the data collectors didn't use placeholders so I can't just copy each variable column I need and start working with the data from there. I need to sort the data (while keeping each value that corresponds with each individual) and insert blanks/ spaces as needed so that I can analyze the data. However, there are tens of thousands of individuals in this study so if possible I'd like to avoid having to sort it all by hand. 
Is there a good way to lock cells together and sort from there and match up corresponding individuals' data (while inserting blanks as needed?
