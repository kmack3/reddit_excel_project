Is there a way to merge rows of data so that if any cells in on row contain data, but the cells in the same column of a different row are empty, the merge will retain the data? (Example included)
I have combined two tables of data, all contact information. I plan to remove duplicates from the list based on email address. 

But I want to retain any other data associated with that email address. 

Here is an example: http://imgur.com/a/jSXD1

Doing it one by one, though, would take far too long since it is over a thousand rows of data. Are there any tools out there can facilitate?

Remove email duplicate, then index match

    =INDEX($B4:$B5,MATCH($A11,$A4:$A5,0))

Drag across and down
