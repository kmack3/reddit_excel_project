Using LOOKUP function for dates
Below is a sample of data relating to the movements of a vessel in and out of a harbour:

What I want to do is have a function which will tell me the trip number that we were on by the end of each day.

So for example, by the end of the 21st the vessel had made 2 trips, by the end of the 22nd the vessel had made 9 trips, by the end of the 23rd the vessel had made 17 trips, and so on-so-forth.

Let's say I want the number trips by the end of the 21st for example then:
So what I'm thinking is maybe it needs to be some kind of lookup function where it looks up the last cell corresponding to "21-05-17", and then with some offset, output the corresponding trip number which is 2.

I have no idea, I'm open to anything

Cheers


-------------
You could easily obtain this with a pivot table. Date on the Rows field, and count of trip on the Values field.
-------------
You can accomplish this with a countifs statement. Create a cell for day, month and year input (say, cell D1, D2 and D3, respectively). Then, based on your data, you could use:

=COUNTIFS(B:B,">="&DATE(D3,D2,D1),B:B,"<"&DATE(D3,D2,D1+1))

EDIT: Obviously you can also explicitly use a full date in one cell for the reference, but it looks like you want to change just the day of the month. Hope that helps.

If you then want to access this data, either VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH on the pivot table.
