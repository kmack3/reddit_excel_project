Is there a way to unlock a cell if another cell.value = "Other"?
I want to be able to lock all cells in a column so that they are not editable unless the cell to the left has "Other".

I know how to do this with Workbook_Change event. But I would like to be able to do this without saving 50+ macro enabled workbooks.

Any suggestions?


-------------
Try this

Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    If Range("A1") = "Other" Then
        Range("B1:B4").Locked = False
    ElseIf Range("A1") <> "Other" Then
        Range("B1:B4").Locked = True
    End If
End Sub

Thanks for the reply. I know about this approach. I am hoping that I can solve my problem without saving as a macro enabled workbook.

Have you tried Data Validation? You can set it up by formula so that it accepts any value when a certain cell says "Other" - e.g. validation on B1 would look like:

    =OR(UPPER(A1)="OTHER",B1="")

Thanks a lot for the help. Just so I am understanding correctly, I would put this into column B?

Yep, exactly.
