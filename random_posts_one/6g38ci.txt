VBA: Multiple cells must contain this data before running the rest of this Macro
I have this macro that removes some of the content of "I" if "P" is the current year or more. I only need the macro to process the partial removal of "I" if "AE" contains any of the following data Rugby, AFL, NRL, A-League or NBL. How do I add this extra step in the macro? 

    Sub RemoveRound()
    'remove the round number for programs for this year
    For i = 2 To Cells(Rows.count, 16).End(xlUp)
        If Range("P" & i) > Year(Now()) Then
            If InStr(Range("I" & i), "Round") > 0 Then
                Text = Range("I" & i)
                NewText = Right(Text, Len(Text) - InStr(Text, " "))
                NewNewText = Right(NewText, Len(NewText) - InStr(NewText, " "))
                Range("I" & i) = NewNewText
            End If
        End If
    Next i
    
    End Sub
