Retrieving the h:mm sum of non-neighboring time sets
I've been googling this for a few hours, and I get a lot of examples for how to find the sum in a linear row or column (A1:A20, etc), but when attempting to find the sum of non-neighboring cells, it's not returning a value. I'm sure I'm just forgetting to do something simple. 

Basically, I'm making a timesheet. I work from home, so I tend to work in three or four chunks over the course of the day. I want to find out how many hours I've worked for each chunk, and then add those hours/minutes up to find my total for the day.

You can see in the function box how I'm retrieving the total of that chunk for day 7. I'm having difficulty with the total column, though. I've been trying this:

    =SUM(D7,G7,J7,M7,P7)

But it just returns 0:00. I played with the time/number format, but it doesn't seem to help. 

I'm just going to be preemptively embarrassed. I'm sure I've just done something dumb, lol. But any advice is appreciated!

is this correct? 

    =SUM(D7,G7,J7,M7,P7)

Based on your screenie it looks like it should be 

    =SUM(E7,I7,M7,Q7)

The formula in `E7` casts the time as text, and `SUM` is pointed at text. Instead of using the `TEXT` function, just do the math `=D7-C7`, and format that column as "h:mm". The `SUM` should work after that.

Do not wrap in TEXT, it is text.

Just format the cell as required `[h]:mm` it remains as a number

Ahhh, y'all were right! I had it wrapped as TEXT because of a tutorial I was following. It's working great now. Thanks!

Thanks so much! You're right, it works without TEXT.
