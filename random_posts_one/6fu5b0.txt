Help determining chart series index based on selection
I want to create code to edit a chart such that it will take the currently selected series and switch it from line to column, and vice versa

This is the code from a recorded macro where I selected a series:

    ActiveChart.FullSeriesCollection(2).Select
    ActiveChart.FullSeriesCollection(2).ChartType = xlColumnClustered

Seems straightforward, but what is the best way to get the index (2) from the current selection.  I think it'll be something like:

    dim srs as Series
    dim srsNumber as Integer
    
    Set srs = ????
    srsNumber = srs.index

I just can't figure out the ???? part.  Thanks.


-------------
The index is apparently part of the formula for the series, so just use string calculations on formula to pull it out

        sForm = Selection.Formula
        fPart = Mid(sForm, InStrRev(sForm, ",") + 1)
        srsIndex = Left(fPart, Len(fPart) - 1)
