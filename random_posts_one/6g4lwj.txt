Count scholarships
I'm making a list of people going camping with a Youth group. People are going to be paying with cash, check, or scholarship. What's the formula to count only the scholarships? Thanks in advance

Use COUNTIF where you can count with a criteria.

`=COUNTIF ( Range , criteria )`

Thank you!
