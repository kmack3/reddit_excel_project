Categorize values in one column, by giving labels stated in other column.
Hi guys,

I have an excel sheet with +/- 1000 rows of transactions. Every transaction is briefly described in column "G". In column "T" I want to label each row based on the description. The description can contain multiple different words (or part of words) in order to be allocated to one category. Would their be a macro that takes care of this, when I give the input: [unique categories, values that the cell needs to contain to be allocated to a category]?

Thanks in advance!
