A method to count the colored Cells?
Scenario: Following cells
a1  - highlighted green
a2  - highlighted green
a3 - highlighted yellow
a4 -  - highlighted red

Is there a way to make a counter that says:
2 green
1 yellow
1 red

Thanks

I posted this method last week to determine the color of a cell. From there you can count how many etc.

Not easily. Using VBA, yes. But first, are the cells coloured as part of a conditional formatting setup? If so, then you can leverage that to count the number of times the conditions are met rather than count the resulting colours.
