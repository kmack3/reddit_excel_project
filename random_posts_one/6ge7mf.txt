Wondering about a formula in a spreadsheet that was given. Number > comma > rows
=SUBTOTAL(9,V2:V3054)

Trying to figure out what the '9,' is for. Something isn't adding up, but if I try to remove the 9, it doesn't accept. 

Thanks for the quick answer everyone!

Its a function number for SUMing the range

`SUBTOTAL` does a lot of different totals. [see help file here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SUBTOTAL-function-7b027003-f060-4ade-9040-e478765b9939)

>Method: The type of subtotal to create.

There's a list on the site I linked below. That first number is essentially a code that determines which *type* of subtotal you want (average, count, max, min, product, etc.).

"SUBTOTAL", "something isn't adding up". Unintentional joke?
