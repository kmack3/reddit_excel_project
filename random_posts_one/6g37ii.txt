Correct Sumifs statement with lots of criteria
I have about 50 cost centers I am trying to sum in different columns when I use =SUMIFS(O37:AN37,O34:AN34,Sheet1!A2:A18) to sum my first group and =SUMIFS(O37:AN37,O34:AN34,Sheet1!C2:C37) for my second the same values are returned to me. What am I doing wrong?


-------------
Needs to be an array. SUM(SUMIFS()) and then CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER instead of just pressing enter - 


    =SUM(SUMIFS($O$37:$AN$37,$O$37:$AN$37,Sheet1!$A$2:$A$18))

Article I wrote on SUM(SUMIFS()) though I don't go into the array portion, only hard coding. http://itsnotaboutthecell.com/2016/02/16/sum-count-average-functions/
