Keeping formatting across an entire Worksheet
So I *almost* have this working. If I can figure out how to select the entire sheet or a range bigger than a cell, I am *set*. 

I need to convert symbols to Latex format in an Excel spreadsheet. If I have a symbol like H2O in Column A, then I have to have H_{2}O in Column B to represent the Latex form of specifying subscripts. For superscripts, I would have to have x^{2}.

Now I can do those substitutions in Word, but I also have other substitutions that I am doing in Excel using VBA. I have to convert # to \# and _ to \_. So CK# would become CK\# and BC_n would become BC\_n. I want to be able to make these substitutions in VBA without changing the original subscript/superscript format of the original symbols. That way I can take the formatted symbols into Word and make the final subscript/superscript formats there. 

Here is my VBA code. It does exactly what I need it to do for one cell. Now I just need it to do that for an entire worksheet, or at least one entire column at a time. 

Thank you so much for your help.

     Sub CopyKeepFormat()

     Dim rSrc As Range, rDest As Range, rng As Range
     Dim j As Long


     Set rSrc = Worksheets("Trial1").Range("A41") 'source cell
     Set rDest = Worksheets("Sheet2").Range("A41") ' destination 
     cell
    
      ' first copy source cell to destination cell, this keeps the 
        formats
    
      rSrc.Copy Destination:=rDest
    
      ' replace "_" with "\_" and "#" with "\#" keeping the formats

       For j = Len(rDest.Value) To 1 Step -1

          Select Case Mid(rDest.Value, j, 1)
        
              Case "_":
                  rDest.Characters(j + 1, 0).Insert ("\_")
                  rDest.Characters(j, 1).Delete
                
              Case "#":
                  rDest.Characters(j + 1, 0).Insert ("\#")
                  rDest.Characters(j, 1).Delete
                
              Case Else:
            
          End Select

      Next j

      End Sub

Yeah, that works. 

Now I'm trying to figure out how to include the Greek alphabet and degree symbol in my switch statement. 

So if my symbol includes the Greek alpha, I have to replace that with \alpha wherever that letter is located. How do I do that?

I tried just using ChrW(unicode number), but it didn't work for the switch statement. 

Thanks.

Sorry my phone wasn't showing your post correctly.

I'm can't get to my computer right now, but I'll check it out when I can and get back to you.
