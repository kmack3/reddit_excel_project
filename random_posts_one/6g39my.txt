Trouble using VLOOKUP with chosen variables that repeat portions of text (ie. a1, b1, c1, a2, b2, c2)

As you can see, I compared a list of variables and numbers with my preferred list of variables and the same numbers.  
  
I have no idea why the VLOOKUP formula produces inconsistent results.  I imagine there's some sort of text rule that I'm unaware of.  Thanks for looking at this!

Try setting the last parameter in the VLOOKUP to False

Exact matching is definitely the problem!
