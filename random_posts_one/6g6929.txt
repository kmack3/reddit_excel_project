Googlesheets Question- Can anyone help me with the below?
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iqYxtxTFDwE5k7xG5eNAtAzWqSHe9qUk4KIiz3yGdas/edit?usp=sharing  

My formula is:

=SUMIF(SCORES 6-7-17'!$B:$B,$A5,'SCORES 6-7-17'!$W:$W)  

It should be returning 1 or -1 but is returning zero and I cannot figure out why.

In Column W you have an IF formula.
=if(T11>T10,"1",if(T11=T10,"0","-1"))

Between " means Excel/Sheets sees them as string/text, not numbers!
Remove the " and it should work.

Btw in sheet ML you had a bad formula too.
=sumif('SCORES 5--9-17'!$B:$B,$A7,'SCORES 5-9-17'!$W:$W)

Changed it to 
=sumif('SCORES 5-9-17'!$B:$B,$A7,'SCORES 5-9-17'!$W:$W)

Columns AC till AF all refer to the same date scoresheet.
You should use Indirect here.

Thank you!

What do you mean by use indirect here?

On your ML sheet you have the dates.
For each date you have a scoresheet. With INDIRECT you can dynamic refer to them.
This way you can drag your formulas from left to right. Now you have an error in columns AC till AF because you didn't link to the correct scoresheets.

SUM example that works, adjust to your liking:
=SUM(INDIRECT("'Score "& TEXT(A1,"d-m-yyyy") &"'!"&"A:A"))

Because you dates, you should always use 1 way for formatting because in the formula above I use "d-m-yyyy" (European here).
If your format is US then change the formula the part to "m-d-yyyy".
If a month or date has 1 number then don't put a zero in front of it.
Example:
1-1-2017 (correct format ("d-m-yyyy"))
01-01-2017 (wrong format ("dd-mm-yyyy"))

The wrong format could also be used, but then change the TEXT formula.
