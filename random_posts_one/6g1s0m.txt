Transforming values in a table to an equivalent creating another table.
Hey guys! First time posting so pardon me if I make any mistakes in the process. Im using Excel 2016 in Mac and I am basically looking to create a macro that allows you to transform the values in a list (in a table) into the given equivalents I need. Like this, (I wrote this myself, I do not know how to give the equivalents to each value) http://imgur.com/nWOBRXt. Basically press the button and switch Fruit 1 with its equivalent of value and put it in a separate list. Also the range of values I need to transform won't always be in the same list, so going back to the example sometimes I can have fruit 1 in my list but sometimes I wont have that value but Ill have fruit 20 that I also need excel to know that would be an apple for example. G, this is confusing but I hope I can gain some clarity here. If there is anything else y'all would like to know just ask!
Thanks beforehand.

why do you need a macro if you can just use logical expressions?
-------------
well that is an option to, I wanted to do it that way since it is a platform that other people will be using and that with the press of a button they could obtain the necessary information. Do you have any idea about a way to do so differently?

The thing about macros is that you have to understand how they work otherwise if they break who's to fix it?

I'm not understanding how you get the translated values, basically how to arrive at the output values. It seems like a simple index-match based on what you're asking but maybe there's more to it.
