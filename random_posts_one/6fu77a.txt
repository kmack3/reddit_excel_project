is there any way to make the xnpv function conditional?
i have a stream of cash flows that are tagged by different sources, and i'd like to calculate the pv of each source. something like a sumifs or averageifs, but with the xnpv function. i can break them out into different columns, but i'm wondering if there's a more elegant solution.

thanks in advance
