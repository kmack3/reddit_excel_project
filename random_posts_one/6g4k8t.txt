Need Help with an excel MOD function
I need help modeling a function that will return a fixed value (x) every N months beginning at month N. For example, I want to project $100 In sales every 6 months starting at month 10.

Bonus: It would be helpful to also have a set quantity of sales. For example, 11 total sale events.

Hey,

I made a formula according to your latest request which includes repeat duration. In cell A1:

    =IF(AND(COLUMN(A1)>=$A$5,COLUMN(A1)<($A$5+($B$5*$C$5)),MOD(COLUMN(A1)-$A$5,$B$5)=0),$D$5,0)

Then copy and paste across all column months. I made all the values dynamic, corresponding to:

* A5 = What month to start the repeat
* B5 = How many months between each repeat
* C5 = How many times to repeat
* D5 = Amount of projection

In your example, it would be 

* A5 = 10
* B5 = 6
* C5 = 11
* D5 = 100

Logic: checks if current cell's column is all of the following:

* larger than the "starting" month
* smaller than the starting month + the entire duration of your repeat rule
* cleanly divisible [no remainder] by the repeat frequency, starting at the start month

If all is true, then output the projection amount. If not, then output 0.

I've used the function: IF(MOD(Cell("col",A1),6)=0,100,0) which works well, but I can't seem to adapt it to start in month N.

Incredible. Thank you so much. Formula works flawlessly. :)

Hi there. I'm trying to think of a better way to explain. Say I have a 100 month spread with 1 month in each column starting at month one in column A. I want to be able to model a value (say $100 in sales) every six months starting in month 10, for 11 times in total.
