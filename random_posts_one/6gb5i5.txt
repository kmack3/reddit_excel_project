How can I get this to run in the background?
    Sub my_Procedure()
        Dim Sh As Worksheet
    Dim Rng As Range
    Dim Cell As Range
    Dim strBatchName As String
    strBatchName = "C:\Users\yty\Desktop\downloadcleanup.bat"
    Shell strBatchName
    strBatchName = "C:\Users\yty\Desktop\downloadcleanup2.bat"
    Shell strBatchName
    Set Sh = Worksheets("sheet1")
    With Sh
        Set Rng = .Range("A1:A2")
        ' & .Cells(.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row)
    End With
    For Each Cell In Rng
        ThisWorkbook.FollowHyperlink Cell.Value
    Next Cell
    Call test ' for starting timer again
    End Sub

    Sub test()
    Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:15:00"), "my_Procedure"
    End Sub

trying to find a way to get this to run in the background, can anyone point me in the right direction with this?

You can't. VBA isn't multi-threaded.

However, with Power query (G&T in 2016) you CAN get it to execute a query every so many minutes...

Gotta ask: why run 2 separate batch files sequentially rather than combine them into one batch file, have the first call the second, or just call a 3rd batch file which runs the first 2?

Looks like every 15 minutes you want to run the 2 batch files then follow some hyperlinks. Using __Shell__, the batch files run in separate processes. Is the problem that they run in console windows covering the Excel windows? If so, change lines 7 and 9 above to

    Shell Pathname:=strBatchName, WindowStyle:=vbMinimizedNoFocus

You can most definitely run this in the background - though I would recommend doing so on a virtual machine if possible and building logical restrictions. Research the OnTime VBA below.

    Application.OnTime

Based on the answers so far, it's not clear what you mean by 'background'. 

Do you mean a process that runs in Excel while you continue to work in Excel without interruption? (u/small_trunks has that answer)

Or do you mean a process that runs on a schedule? (u/hrlngrv and u/itsnotaboutthecell have that... and I would add that the batch script can be executed as a Windows process using the task scheduler, in case that works for you.

You'd have to use a workbook event (based on what I'm reading, most people are using the workbook open event.) You can see how to do so [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2319683/vba-macro-on-timer-style-to-run-code-every-set-number-of-seconds-i-e-120-secon)

Damn, the way I have it going now I just created another user in Windows and have just that running in it. That's the best way I can come up with

I'm running two because I don't know what I'm doing, ;) I'll try this here in a sec and let you know. Thank you for your help

Go look at power query...
