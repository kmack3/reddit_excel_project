Weird question: gmail keeps switching to Excel when attaching a sheet. How to switch this off?
Hi all, I have a bit weird question, and I hope this is the right place.  
When I'm using gmail and want to attach an excel sheet, as soon as I select the excel sheet, it will activate Excel, and bring forward an open (but minimized) excel sheet. This is obviously frustrating, since I need to alt-tab back to Chrome and click 'open' to attach the file.

Is anyone familiar with this issue? It happens on with Gmail on Chrome, Excel 2010, Win7. I tried to reproduce this on my Mac, but there everything works like it should. Thanks a lot!  
This behaviour does not occur with Word or Powerpoint, so it seems excel-specific...

Have you tried dragging the file into the gmail window and dropping within the message?

Hi, thanks for your reply! This works, but when working on a laptop it isn't always convenient to do this.

Since you have chrome, you may be able to copy the file and paste into the message.
