Printing welcome letters with variabilities
Hey guys,

So I started as an intern in this company and naturally I get the most life-sucking tasks. One that particularly bugs me out is printing welcome letters for guests. 

I tried to figure out how to automatize the process of making them because for just a dozen letters I can spend the whole day, which I don't consider as time well spent. I am hoping some of you might have a solution to my problem. 

So I get the raw data like this: http://imgur.com/a/bzbKS and I have to go one by one making the letters. 

The letters look like this(yellow is what changes either from day to day or from person to person): http://imgur.com/a/wbxOc

The variables are titles, names, flight numbers, flight departure times, hospitality desk hours and so on. 

My thinking is that if I could make a database from the data I get, I could somehow connect Word with Excel and print out the final letter. I can't say how much it would mean to me if someone could share how to do this, or any better way. Thanks for reply!

I am working currently, so I can't share you the exact details right now, but you can use Word to get it's data straight from Excel, and use it to send letters to everyone.  
  
If the excel sheet contains everything, you can make a template Word, and leave out the 'variable' parts, (name, times, etc) and pull those from Excel, using the Mailings menu in Word.  
  
Edit.: And of course, the most right button in the Mailings menu (sorry my Excel is not in English) will provide a function to print them all :)

Look up mailmerge in Word.
