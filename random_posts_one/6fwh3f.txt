Need help to put together a spreadsheet that gathers data(bets) from bookies.
I am a semi pro e-sports better and I want to create a spreadsheet that can collect the odds from different sites so it's easy to see where I can get the highest odds. I have toyed around with the import data from the internet functions, but to little success.

The 2 primary sites I need to gather bets from are.
