Formatting question: Grouping observations with alternating highlights
I have data sorted into a bunch of different groups with a different number of observations per group. I'd like to highlight the rows in alternate colors based on the groups. 

Hopefully this makes sense. I want it to look like:

Color 1 Highlight:
Group A - observation 1
Group A -observation 2

Color 2 Highlight:
Group B - Observation 1

Color 1 Highlight:
Group C- Obs 1
Group C - Obs 2
Group C - Obs3

and on and on. Is there an easy way to do this?

Eh, that formatting didn't come out as I expect, each observations is a row in Excel.

you can edit your post!

I do not understand the question. A clearer example maybe required as no one else has answered either.
