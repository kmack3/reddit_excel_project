VBA delete filtered table row - but not entire row
I'm trying to delete a row from a **filtered** table using VBA, but I only want to delete the row *within* the table and not the entire sheet row.

The row I want to delete will be visible, but it won't be the only visible row.

Thanks in advance

    Sub delTableRow()
    
        ' Delete the 2nd row in tblTest
        '  but not the entire sheet row, as there may be data adjacent to the table.
        ' The table will be filtered.
         
        Dim tblRow As Long
        Dim tbl As ListObject
        
        tblRow = 2 + 1    ' add 1 to account for header row
        Set tbl = shtTest.ListObjects("tblTest")
    
        ' So far I have tried...
        
        ' tbl.ListRows(tblRow).Delete               'only works on unfiltered table
        ' tbl.Range.EntireRow(tblRow).Delete        'works on a filtered table but deletes the entire row
        ' tbl.Range.Rows(tblRow).Delete shift:=xlUp 'only works on unfiltered table
    
    End Sub
