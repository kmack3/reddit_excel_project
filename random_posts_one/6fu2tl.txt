VBA Copy Paste Values to next empty row in table
Hi guys, in my project I had a macro set up that would copy paste values from a calculation table into a results table upon pressing a button. Afterwards I would do new calculations and copy those results into the table as well below the other results. 

The macro looks as follows:


    Sub Copy_Results()
    '
    ' Copy_Results Macro
    ' Copy Pasts Results from Input Tab to Results Tab
    '

    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Dim copySheet As Worksheet
    Dim pasteSheet As Worksheet

    Set copySheet = Worksheets("Input")
    Set pasteSheet = Worksheets("Results")

    copySheet.Range("Sales_Table").Copy
    pasteSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Offset(1, 0).PasteSpecial xlPasteValues
    Application.CutCopyMode = False
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    End Sub


This macro stopped working in the intended way after the project evolved. The first copy paste usually works fine but after that subsequent values get pasted way below the existing ones. Looks like they get pasted below the selected area or something...


For your information the Table that gets copied is usually only filled partially with values starting from the top. So maybe it would work better if I would not copy the whole table?


Any help is appreciated.
