Need to Find The Same Numbers In Six Columns
I have 6 columns of varying row heights that contain numbers and I need to find any number that may appear more than once in all of the columns. I have no idea how to quickly do this. I'm really bad with VLOOKUP and if there were only two columns I think I'd be okay.

Use conditional formatting to find duplicates?
