How to extract text after third comma
I have a text string where I'd like to extract all text after the third occurrence of a comma. 

Example A1 contains:
    2353,post,http://www.examplesite.com/,Donec ullamcorper nulla non metus auctor, fringilla

I'm hoping to isolate, in its own cell: Donec ullamcorper nulla non metus auctor, fringilla

Thanks!

It looks like you're working with a csv, is that it? Because it would be easier to split this to different columns.

Data > Data tools > Text to columns, and use comma as a separator. Then you'll be able to access your files without difficult formulas.
-------------
`=RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-FIND("@@@",SUBSTITUTE(A1,",","@@@",3)))`
 where `@@@` is text guaranteed not to be in your source data.
-------------
The problem with text to columns in this situation is that it would separate "Donec ullamcorper nulla non metus auctor, fringilla" into 2 columns

Thanks for the help u/rnelsonee. This works perfectly, and helps keep the sheet a bit cleaner instead of using text to columns.
