Running Accuracy Function?
http://imgur.com/a/9M3p2

I am looking to keep a running accuracy in the "Running Accuracy Column". The first day in row 2 would read "74%". The second column would sum C2 & C3 and then divide by the sum of b2 & b3. I could do this manually, but I'm sure there is an easier way.


-------------
In E2, and then drag down: `=SUM(C$2:C2)/SUM(B$2:B2)`
