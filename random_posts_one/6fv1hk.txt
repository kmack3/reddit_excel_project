How can I link a shapes color in one sheet to the state of a checkbox in another?
I converted a chevron smart art into shapes and I would like to change the color to green when a checkbox is clicked. How do I go about doing this? I tried to adjust code that would change a cells color but could not get it to work. Once I get one working I plan to duplicate it and make numerous of these chart 'trackers' to track the status (complete vs not) of multiple projects as steps of each are completed. When something is completed, the box will be checked, and in another sheet this will be shown via changing the color of the chevron (similar to dominoes pizza tracker).

You'll need something like the below for each checkbox. This will fill the area around the shape green. 
     
     Private Sub CheckBox1_Click()
     ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array("Diagram 1")).Fill.ForeColor.RGB = vbGreen
     End Sub

If the shape is in the next sheet how do I go about adjusting the code accordingly.  I did get it to work when in the same sheet

Add this line before the activesheet line

     Sheets("your sheet name here in the quotes").Activate

Great! Thank you so much. I hate to ask one more clarification but if I'd like to make an if statement for whether the box is ticked or not so that when it is unticked it changes the color back to a white filler, how do I adjust what ive tried to make it work.

    Private Sub CheckBox2_Click ()
    If ActiveSheet.CheckBox2.Value = True Then
    Sheets("Sheet2").Activate
     ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array("Freeform 4")).Fill.ForeColor.RGB = vbGreen
     Else: ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array("Freeform 4")).Fill.ForeColor.RGB = vbRed
     End If
     End Sub

Really appreciate the help.

Edit: In the code I put red but ideally it would revert back to being white, just wasnt sure what the code would be.

Change sheet names/object names as needed in the below. cleaned up the activate steps a little in this one. Should be a little more efficient. 

    Private Sub CheckBox1_Click()
    If Sheets("Sheet1").CheckBox1.Value = True Then

     Sheets("Sheet2").Shapes.Range(Array("Diagram 1")).Fill.ForeColor.RGB = vbGreen
 
     Else:
     Sheets("Sheet2").Shapes.Range(Array("Diagram 1")).Fill.ForeColor.RGB = vbRed
 
     End If
     End Sub
