Mac excel v15.34 (latest version i think): Missing "control group" in developer tab
Hi! I'm really new to excel and I'm trying to learn how to VBA. I am trying to insert an ActiveX command button and am following youtube videos and I cannot seem to find the freaking button! Am I crazy? Screenshot in the link. I also went through the customize toolbar and didn't see the option
