Which takes up less space-conditional form. or numb. formatting?
Which uses less space-Conditional Formatting by writing a rule across cells or using custom number formatting?

I have several cells that contain a formula. When the result is a negative percentage, I need the percentage to become red and have a parentheses. I need to use either method, but the spreadsheet has many tabs and takes a long time to load and process changes. I want the quickest method. Also, where can I find a list of custom number formats or something that explains how to do them? We have in other cells a custom format of:  $#,##0,_);[Red]$(#,##0,)   No idea who came up with that or how it works.
