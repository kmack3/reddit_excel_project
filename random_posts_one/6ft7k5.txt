Using formula to search for all S&P 500 company names on spreadsheet containing all of Donald Trump's tweets. Need formula for partial match.
Hi,

I've been playing around with a spreadsheet posted by another reddit user containing all of Trump's tweets , seeing if I can isolate the tweets that mention company names. So far I've put together a formula that works only for an exact match, when I'd like it to work for a partial match. Is there any way of doing this?

The formula for an exact match is:

=IF(COUNT(SEARCH('S&P 500 '!B2:B506,Sheet5!C1607)),"match","no match")

where B2:B506 is the column of S&P500 companies and C1607 is the cell containing the tweet text.

Thanks

R

What are example values, what are expected results?

Which part is partial matching?

Is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/6fbchi/can_i_highlight_q_single_cell_w_a_partial_text/digyzmp/?context=3) the sort of thing you mean?

If you're trying anything like that, best of luck! Like they said, it'll take a lot more than Excel to distinguish between an apple you eat and Apple the company.

But, for what you want to do, I'm guessing this site's formula will work - it worked for me with a test case:

The formula is:

    =SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(SEARCH('S&P 500'!$B$2:$B$506,C1607)))>0

Thanks for that. Would you use ctrl+shift+enter because its an array? and also, would this just match whole words?

I re-read your question and realized you wanted partial matches. This will only match whole words. My best guess would be to add on to your S&P 500 list an additional list of potential partials. Otherwise, I'm not sure how you would do that.

But no, you do not need to enter this as an array.

Working a bit better now but I've realised that it is returning true if a company name in the array fits within another word in the cell. Eg: At from AT & T is included in "what". Any way to fix this or make it case sensitive?

Are you using the formula I provided? Or a different one?
