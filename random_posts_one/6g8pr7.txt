I have something like this set up, and it works well and dandy, but for some reason the $150 seems shifted 1 character to the right.  So it's not lined up and looks kind of wonky. Can't tell any difference between the cells, please help remedying this!

They are right justified FYI, if I left justify them, they line up fine, but if I right justify them, the $150 goes just a tad more to the right.....cells are same size throughout.

i FIXED IT by copying a blank cell into the box and just redoing the formula...not sure why that block was messed up but it works fine now

Haha, for future reference, Ctrl+1 brings up the formatting for a cell. You probably had a pad in there. Another way, select a cell which has a format you like (so any old cell if you want default), hit Format Painter right below Copy, then click on your cell you want to adopt that format. Super cool tool.
