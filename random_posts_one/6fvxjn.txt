Excel file opens but nothing appears.
97-2003 excel file e-mailed from another company contains spreadsheet data but when I open the file on my computer it is just the excel header and footer and no sheet. I can send it to a co-workers PC and he can open it and everything shows up. Running Excel 2010. I have searched online and everything is about opening blank sheets. It's opening a blank excel window a sheet doesn't even show up.

Maybe a dumb question, but is it just that you're viewing an empty worksheet (and the data is on another worksheet) or a location on a non-empty worksheet and you need to scroll around until you find where the data is?

Sounds like [hidden sheets](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/microsoft-office/hide-excel-sheets-really-hide-them/) - a nasty little empire building trick.

Nope it has data on it. I just figured out from a spiceworks forum that clicking view {Full Screen} would show data and that indeed worked so the data is there. However if I minimize it back to normal screen size I cannot see the data again. So weird :\

Empire building? lol what?
-------------
Wha? Switching to full screen view mode (Alt-W-E) shows data but reverting back to a normal mode makes it disappear? What appears in the formula bar when you click on a cell that is supposed to contain data?

Office power. Illicit job security. Controlling data. Making yourself indispensable because only you can do xyz.

Mate if you're relying on peoples inability to do this:  
  
    Sub shwSheets()  
    
      For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Sheets()
        ws.Visible = True
      Next ws  
    
    End Sub  
  
You're not building a very big empire...

Love it! Thanks for sharing.

90% of Excel users can't and we wouldn't have a subreddit without them.
