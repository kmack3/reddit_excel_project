countif within a date/year range
what I need to do, and I can't seem to get it right is count the amount of entries in a variety of month/years

ie: 
=COUNTIF(DETAILS!T:T, "=12/2013")

next row
ie: =COUNTIF(DETAILS!T:T, "=1/2014")

after I've done a count I would need to also do a sumif on Details column S based on the dates as well.

the data in DETAILS!T:T is the date (ie fiormatted 12/12/2013) and the details in DETAILS!S:S is the cash value.

and so on.. it seems that when it comes to counting dates the formulas always stump me! 

thank you!

Dates are a bit fickle in excel especially when searching against values, I suggest you use the TEXT function to reformat dates so that the values match the same type. For example, making a helper column which converts the dates in column T:

    =TEXT($T1,"MM/YYYY")

This way you don't have to worry about dates being interpreted as weird strings etc.

solution verified! 

yeah, that works... counting dates is always so frustrating to me... it seems like it should be super easy but it never is.

Awesome, good to hear. Edited post because apparently that comment worked.
