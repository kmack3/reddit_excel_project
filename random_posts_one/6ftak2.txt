Problems with OutlookMail.To...
Hi all, I have a question that I hope will be brief to answer, since I think that I'm pretty close to working code!

I'm making a sheet for the company I work for to help manage change. This sheet, in a tab called "MOC" shows 18 toggle buttons (numbers 7-24) that each correspond to a specific area/discipline. Each area corresponds to a specific point of contact in the facility. The idea is that a person will come into the sheet, explain the change that they will be making, check all the potential affected areas, and then hit "Send." This send button will forward the sheet, using Outlook, to the points of contact assigned to the areas that were checked in the sheet. This is where I'm having issues. I've tried a few different things, some of which would "gather" a list of email recipients and send *one* email, while others will check each area individually, and send the email if the area is affected, and send nothing if it's not. It doesn't matter to me which way this is executed.

I have all of the points of contact on a second tab called "POC". Column A is empty, column B has the areas starting in row 3, and column C has the email addresses also starting in row 3. Column D is titled "Included?" and I coded into the toggle buttons that if ToggleButtonX.Value = True Then an "X" will be placed in the cell in this column corresponding to the same area. Also I'm using column E (may not be needed) just to say =IF(D3="Yes",C3,""). One of my attempts (#1 below), attempted to look for all of the "Yes" instances, and send the email to those people.

Attempt #1:
    For r = 3 To 20
        If Sheets("POC").Cells(r, 4).Value = "Yes" Then
            EmailList = Cells(r, 3)
            With OutlookMail
            .To = EmailList
            'Subject Line, Body, and Attachments
            .Subject = "ACTION REQUIRED - Small Change Management Automated Email"
            .Body = "A small change is awaiting your approval. Please see document attached."
            .Attachments.Add Application.ActiveWorkbook.FullName
                'Send the Email
                If MsgBox("Are you sure you are ready to send this report?", vbOKCancel, "Report Mailer") = vbCancel Then
                    Exit Sub
                Else
                End If
            .Send
            End With
            'Reset
            Set OutlookMail = Nothing
            Set OutlookApp = Nothing
        End If
    Next r


Attempt #2:
    'If ToggleButton7.Value = True Then
    '    Email1 = Sheets("POC").Range("C3").Value
    'Else
    '    Email1 = ""
    'End If
    '
    'If ToggleButton8.Value = True Then
    '    Email2 = Sheets("POC").Range("C4").Value
    'Else
    '    Email2 = ""
    'End If
    '
    'With OutlookMail
    '    .To = Email1
    '    .To = Email2
    '    .Subject = "ACTION REQUIRED - Small Change Management Automated Email"
    '    .Body = "A small change is awaiting your approval. Please see document attached."
    '    .Attachments.Add Application.ActiveWorkbook.FullName
    'End With
    '
    'If MsgBox("Are you sure you are ready to send this report?", vbOKCancel, "Report Mailer") = vbCancel Then
    '    Exit Sub
    'Else
    '    OutlookMail.Send
    'End If

Any help is appreciated. I'm open to changing up my process completely if there's a better way! 

Edit:  I can't get the VBA to format pretty here :( Anyone want to help with that too if it's hard to read?
Edit2:  Got them formatted in the comments!


-------------
To apply code formatting;

    Use 4 spaces to start each line

You can select code in your VBA window, press Tab, then copy and paste into your thread or comment.

I think attempt 1's issue is the setting ol objects to nothing.
Attempt 2 you've got .To twice (second will just overwrite the first).

Example of a sub I use to send emails. It is called for each recipient in a list. It is more complicated than you need, but you should be able to use it to work through your "X" marks.

    Sub DistrEml( _
                 sSubj As String, _
                 sBody As String, _
                 sTo As String, _
                 sCC As String, _
                 sBCC As String, _
                 sFrom As String, _
                 sRoot As String, _
                 rAtchs As Range, _
                 sReplacements() As String, _
                 sImages() As String)
                 
        Dim rAtch As Range
        Dim i As Integer
        
        Set oApuri = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
        Set oEmail = oApuri.CreateItem(olMailItem)
        
        With oEmail
            .To = sTo
            .CC = sCC
            .BCC = sBCC
            .Subject = sSubj
            .SentOnBehalfOfName = sFrom
            
            'Images
            For i = LBound(sImages) To UBound(sImages)
                .Attachments.Add sImages(i), olByValue, 0
            Next i
            
    '       Attachments
            For Each rAtch In rAtchs
                If rAtch.Value <> "" Then
                    If Dir(sRoot & rAtch.Value) <> "" Then .Attachments.Add sRoot & rAtch.Value
                End If
            Next rAtch
            sBody = Replacer(sBody, sReplacements)
            .HTMLBody = sBody
            Select Case UCase(Sheet6.Range("J5").Value)
                Case Is = "SEND"
                    .Send
                Case Is = "DISPLAY"
                    .Display
                Case Else
            End Select
        End With
    End Sub

    'Set Necessary Recipients
        For r = 3 To 20
            If Sheets("POC").Cells(r, 4).Value = "Yes" Then
                EmailList = Cells(r, 3)
                With OutlookMail
                .To = EmailList
                'Does anyone need to be CC'd? Jeremy? Kim?
                .CC = ""
                'Subject Line, Body, and Attachments
                .Subject = "ACTION REQUIRED - Small Change Management Automated Email"
                .Body = "A small change is awaiting your approval. Please see document attached."
                .Attachments.Add Application.ActiveWorkbook.FullName
                    'Send the Email
                    If MsgBox("Are you sure you are ready to send this report?", vbOKCancel, "Report Mailer") = vbCancel Then
                        Exit Sub
                    Else

Thank you so much for the reply! I had noticed that the second .To over-wrote the first, but I was just looking for a way to send to numerous people. What would the syntax be for that? Because that's the way that makes the most sense to me. 

Go through each togglebutton, and if the value is true, set email1 = the email address, and if it's false set it equal to nothing. Then at the end, .To should = Email1 & Email2 and .... so on. But that didn't work either. 
-------------
    'Attempt 2 with only two emails
    'If this works, get rid of POC column D
        If ToggleButton7.Value = True Then
            Email1 = Sheets("POC").Range("C3").Value
        Else
            Email1 = ""
        End If
        
        If ToggleButton8.Value = True Then
            Email2 = Sheets("POC").Range("C4").Value
        Else
            Email2 = ""
        End If
        
        With OutlookMail
            .To = Email1
            .To = Email2
            .Subject = "ACTION REQUIRED - Small Change Management Automated Email"
            .Body = "A small change is awaiting your approval. Please see document attached."
            .Attachments.Add Application.ActiveWorkbook.FullName
        End With
        
        If MsgBox("Are you sure you are ready to send this report?", vbOKCancel, "Report Mailer") = vbCancel Then
            Exit Sub
        Else
            OutlookMail.Send
        End If

No, edit your comment in your question above.

I'm on mobile so hopefully this makes sense and formats. 


    For Each cell in addressRange
        If cell.Offset(0, whatever).Value = "X" Then
            .To = .To & "; " & cell.Value
        End If
    Next cell
-------------
    'Attempt 3, using in-sheet IFs
    EmailList = Worksheets("POC").Range("E3:E20")
    With OutlookMail
        .To = EmailList
        .Subject = "Test"
        .Send
    End With

I'll try this first thing tomorrow morning at work! I think that should work. Thanks for helping an intern make an impact lol

Edit:  Worked like a charm! Thanks again

Solution verified!

Grats - welcome to email distribution. Now you'll have to learn HTML to make them look beautiful :)
