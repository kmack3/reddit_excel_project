When this post is 1 minute old, Clippy will go down...
I am going to be moving stuff around in my office and Clippy will be going down.  Flair and Points will be picked up once Clippy is brought back online.

Sorry for any inconvenience.

I have no idea what is happening here

Godspeed, Clippy!

On who?

He must manage the clippy bot that gives points to users for solving problems.  For the bot to work 24/7 it probably had to be logged in.  Since he is moving stuff around his office, the computer will shut down and clippy won't be logged in.  This will cause a delay in updating flair and points.
