Vlookup the column header if a match is found
So I have column A, containing a range of values.

Column B resides the formula, which is the "Classification".

J:S is a table array, of which contains values that can be found in column A. 

I'm trying to make it so that column B will contain a formula that checks a value from column A, in one of the many cells of J:S. And if a value is found, I will pull the column header of the found value, and place it in column B.

I had written a prototype of it earlier but it's not on this pc, it went something like 

    =If(Not Error(Match(A1, J:S, 0 ) , Indirect(Adress(1, Match(A1, J:S, 0)))


Obviously, this doesn't work and I need a little help on that. Can't remember how I wrote the formula exactly, but these are the key features.


-------------
Can you provide a sample table, and your desired outcome? It might be easier to help you if we could visualize what you're trying to do.
-------------
I have a feeling there is a simpler way of doing this, but try:

    =INDEX($A$1:$S$1,SUMPRODUCT((A2=$J:$S)*COLUMN($J:$S)))
-------------

Numbers | formula | a | b | c
---|-------|-|-|-
122 | c | 222 | 33 | 122
222 | a | 444 | 11 | 
444 | a | 442 | 22 | 

-------------


Numbers | Formula | c | a
-------|-------|-|-
11 | c | 22 | 33
22 | c | 11 | 99
33 | a | 444 | 40

I tried this, and it works as expected, however, the performance is horrible! Additional note, when it fails to find a value in the table array, it selects the column header of Column B, which is not an intended outcome (I suppose I could fix it with an if else.)
-------------
Oh damn, posted it twice, hope you get the idea, this is what I imagine it would like like after the formula is punched in. Checks A for value in table array, then copies the header, or first row value of the found column, and writes it in column B

Do you need to use the entire column of J:S? That is probably slowing it down a ton. If your data is within J2:S500, use A2=$J$2:$S$500.
