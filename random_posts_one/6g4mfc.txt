Converting multiple rows into a single column
I have values example like so:

    Row1    Cell1stuff Cell2stuff Cell3stuff ... Cell22stuff
    Row2    Cell1stuff Cell2stuff Cell3stuff ... Cell22stuff
    Row3    Cell1stuff Cell2stuff Cell3stuff ... Cell22stuff

What I want is this:

    Column 1
    Row 1's Cell1stuff
    Row 1's Cell2stuff
    Row 1's Cell3stuff
    Row 1's Cell22stuff
    <Space>
    Row 2's Cell1stuff
    Row 2's Cell2stuff
    Row 2's Cell3stuff
    Row 2's Cell22stuff
    <Space>
    Row 40's Cell1stuff
    Row 40's Cell2stuff
    Row 40's Cell3stuff
    Row 40's Cell22stuff
    <Space>

Can this be done?

Transpose SORTA worked...

I wound up with multiple columns, which I suppose I could get by with if I have to, but I'm trying to build scripts here. Easier if its one column.

Certainly a strange request but have at it!


    Option Explicit
    
    Public Sub dataSpace()
    
    ' /r/Excel
    ' Alex Powers - ItsNotAboutTheCell.com
    
        Dim lastCol As Integer, j As Integer
        Dim lastRow As Long, i As Long
        Dim k As Long
        
        Dim fromSheet As Worksheet
        Set fromSheet = ActiveSheet
        
        lastCol = Cells(1, Columns.Count).End(xlToLeft).Column
        lastRow = Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
        
        Sheets.Add After:=ActiveSheet
        Dim toSheet As Worksheet
        Set toSheet = ActiveSheet
        
        k = 1
        For i = 1 To lastRow
            For j = 1 To lastCol
                fromSheet.Cells(i, j).Copy toSheet.Cells(k, 1)
                k = k + 1
            Next j
            k = k + 1
        Next i
    
    End Sub

Suppose your initial table is B1 to X3, such that B1=Cell1stuff and X3 is blank (but W3 is Cell22stuff).

At A1 have this formula: 

    =""&INDEX($B$1:$X$3,CEILING(ROWS(B$1:B1)/23,1),MOD(ROWS(B$1:B1)-1,23)+1)

drag down.
