Excel Comparing Data
I have two spreadsheets. One has extra orders on it and I want to highlight all the extras. However, the columns are not exactly identical. They both have order #, which I want to compare, but the one file has extra fields like address and stuff. How do I compare just one column but highlight the full column for differences 


-------------
Use `MATCH` with wildcard.

`=MATCH( "*" & value & "*" ,  RANGE  , 0 )`
-------------
I solved it in a pretty complicated way. By pasting both lists into one column and removing duplicates. Now that I have the order #s I need, how do I make the columns with matching order number highlighted?
-------------
Assuming my formula above works, use it in conditional Formatting formula.

With more detailed information it is hard to help further.

Ah okay thanks. How do I change the flair ?
