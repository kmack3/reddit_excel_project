How to Pull Data from Website Exports
I am starting to do digital marketing and I am finding that my data is way too spread out across platforms (Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, Email, Shopify, etc) and all my time is being sucked up exporting data and aggregating it in excel.

Is there a way I can automatically pull reports from these sources into an Excel file? For reference, I used to use SQL/Access to pull queries into excel & powerpivot, I am wondering if there's a way to similarly pull data from the databases on websites.

One option is a third party tool like Supermetrics. Another is to use a platform like R or Python, which requires some coding, but can be used to access various APIs and push the data wherever you want it (including Excel).
