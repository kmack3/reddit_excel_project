How to stop calculating if a certain condition is met?
How do I make it so that if a certain condition is met, it will stop calculating and leave blank cells?

I came up with this:

> =IF(*condition*,"",*formula*)

An example with actual numbers:

> =IF(1:1=0,"",1:1-1)

This means "if row 1 is 0, then leave the cell blank; otherwise, subtract 1".

But the problem is, if I leave the cell blank, then the cells after that gives the #VALUE! error. So then I came up with something like this:

> =IF(1:1="","",IF(1:1=0,"",1:1-1))

This means "if row 1 is blank, then leave the cell blank; if row 1 is 0, then leave the cell blank; otherwise, subtract 1".

So when the value hits 0, it will leave a blank cell, which will leave another blank cell, and so on.

But the problem here is that when I leave blank cells like that, then those cells doesn't have any values in them (like I want), but the formula is still visible in the *fx* bar at the top ... and I don't want that.

I want to make it so that if a certain condition is met in the previous cell, then the following cells will be completely blank without any formulas remaining, as if the cell was deleted.

Thanks.

^(Sorry for my crummy explanation.)

You want a formula to only appear when a value condition is met?

That would require VBA to update cells as required based on cell values changes and dynamic population of a formula when those conditions are met.

u/excelevator hinted at this; I will spell it out: In Excel, a cell can contain a value, a formula, or nothing. Hereinafter I shall refer to a cell's content as the 'state' of a cell. 

An axiom in Excel is: No cell's state can affect the state of another cell.

Therefore what you're asking for is not possible within Excel's formula context. 

However, you can use VBA to modify the state of cells.

Basically, I have a recursive formula, let's say 1:1/2. From a certain initial value, let's say 64, it eventually reaches a certain final value, let's say 1. I want it so that when it reaches 1, the cells after that will have nothing in it - no value, no formula. Just a completely blank cell, as if I hit the delete key.

Now, sorry but I have no clue what you said ... could you try to explain it with easier terms?

What he's saying is that the cells can't delete their own formulas (or the formulas of other cells). To do something like clear out cells automatically, you'd have to use a VBA script.
