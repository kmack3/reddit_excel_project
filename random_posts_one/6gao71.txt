SUMIFS with multiple arrays? Doesn't seem to work.
Imagine you have a table "fruit" with columns Type, Color, Amount.  Why doesn't this array formula work?

    {=SUM(SUMIFS(fruit[amount], fruit[type], {"banana","apple","grape"}, fruit[color], {"green","yellow"}))}

Is there a way around this? I suspect it involves SUMPRODUCT but honestly SUMPRODUCT is a mystery to me -- is there another way around this?


-------------
    =SUMPRODUCT(--ISNUMBER(MATCH(fruit[type],{"apple","grape","banana"},0)),--ISNUMBER(MATCH(fruit[color],{"green","yellow"},0)),fruit[sum])

Problem is that the criteria arrays are different sizes. XL is interpreting the two arrays as 3 criteria:

    Banana-Green
    Apple-Orange
    Grape-Null

If you don't have too many criteria, can you do this?

    {=SUM(SUMIFS(fruit[amount], fruit[type], {"banana","apple","grape"}, fruit[color], "green"))+
      SUM(SUMIFS(fruit[amount], fruit[type], {"banana","apple","grape"}, fruit[color], "yellow"))}

Ah, I think I understand this. Good thinking! Thanks.

Ah, that's a good explanation. I see what you mean. I think we have too many criteria, but I'll keep it in mind. Thank you!

You can also reference a range instead of writing out the match criteria in an array.
