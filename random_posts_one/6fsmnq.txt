Is there any function/option where I could see all the different cells that call upon a single cell?
So I'm working on optimizing an excel file where there are lots of formulas which call upon different cells. However, I noticed that there are 3 identical cells which I could move to one single cell.

My question is: If I select a cell with a formula and edit it, I can see all the cells it calls upon. Is it possible to do the other way around? Select a cell and see all the formulae which call upon that specific cell?

Thank you

PS: I'm currently using MS Excel 2016

Yes. In formula ribbon there is trace option. It will point arrows.
