Pivot table won't fully update when I refresh data
I have a pivot table linked to a data set in a separate sheet. I want to update the data in that sheet, then refresh the pivot table. If I pull in a large data set and it won't all fit in the current pivot table the bottom few lines are stuck with data from the prior data set. 


-------------
Delete all of the old data then? Confused about what you're looking for

Double check your data range.

So I have a sheet that is linked to live data and another sheet that manipulates that data using a pivot table. When i update the data on the sheet from the live data and I come from a small data set to a larger set then go into my other sheet and refresh the pivot table most of the table updates but a few rows at the bottom seem to get stuck and the data just in those couple rows doesn't update but the rest of the table does. 
-------------
Use excel tables for your data. Pivot tables can then determine for themselves how much raw data there is.
-------------
Change your pivot table data range - "Analyze", "Change Data Source", and reselect the new data.
