Formatting for multiple tables in a worksheet
I am building an executive summary type of report where I want to put one table of data, a couple of graphs below, then another table of data below the graphs.  I use the term "table" loosely here as I have not formatted it into an actual table, i.e.: Ctrl+T.  

What I would ideally like is to have the columns for each "table" sized independently of one another so I could size the columns a specific width for the first table and another width for the table below it.  Is this possible?  I know I could move the second table to the right of the first one, but I would prefer to have it so the viewer could simply scroll down.

Maybe don't keep it formatted as a table and instead make certain headers two column wide so that you can adjust them without altering the other table too much.
