allowing user to enter data into cell if logical conditions are met, otherwise calculating value
In a spreadsheet I use an IF as follows:

in cell A5     =IF(*logical test*,*calculation*,85)

This works well. But I would like to change it so that if the logical test is false, the user would be able to enter a value into the cell; if the test is true the calculated value would be placed into the cell.


-------------
    =IF(logical test,calculation,that column which is for manual input)

It sucks but as far as I know the only option really. (usually hide the calculation column)

The OP:

I really was hoping to not have to have a separate cell for user input, or to use VBA. But it does look like I will have to do one or the other. At least I know and regularly use VBA.

Thanks for the help.

This is what I was thinking too, as a quick way to get it to work, but I don't know if OP is willing to use another cell for the input. Not sure of his constraints, but I think in your last "section" of the formula you meant reference the cell that you will have somebody input, right? Or is there something I'm missing?

Thanks. The only problem is that if the user entered a value it would overwrite the "=IF(..." equation. I may well have to use VBA.

What I need is a function that, when true, would place a calculated value into a cell, but when false would do nothing allowing the user to enter a value into the cell.

I will see if there any others have suggestions.

Yes absolutely correct. :)

What it sounds like you are trying to is protect/lock single cells in excel based on conditions. I'd try messing with conditional formatting. Use it you can make it so that if a condition is met, an 'error message' will instead popup preventing entry.  
So in this case, if cell is 85, user would be unable to input a value.  
However, to place 85 there you would probably need VBA otherwise if entry was needed it would overwrite the formula code. I believe you can do this with cell and range VBA functions by setting the value to 85 when a certain condition from other cells is met.  
I'm curious about this though, so I'll look into it later if someone else hasn't come up with a solution.  
My last solution for this was to just have 2 columns, one for entry, and one for the formula. The formula column was always protected while the entry column had selective entry based off conditional formatting.   
Hope this helps some, cheers.
