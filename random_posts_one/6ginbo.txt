How can I extract one piece of data using two vertical lookups
This is for a tracking sheet for apartment renovations - right now someone spends about 2 hours a day manually inputting these dates. 

The imgur pics are simplified - there are around 80 apartments and 20 progress milestones that are tracked as each apartment nears completion. 

I had the inspector start using a google form in hopes of eliminating all of this manual entry and just having these dates autofill from a simple tracking log

Hopefully I'm clear on what I'm trying to do.

For example - Unit 024M had "backsplash install" on 6/7. 

I need something that could search the tracking sheet, match the Unit in Column B, match the Milestone in Column C, and put the Date from Column A into cell E2.

Thanks in advance - reddit gold for whoever can help me out here.

I would recommend using a "key column" and then doing a match/index or vlookup to do whatever matching you want. In the key column you would combine all the values that you want to match on.

The key column would contain this formula:

    =A1 & B1 & C1

And then you'd do a match/index on that column to do whatever else you're trying to do.

You could also use array formulas to do this, but those are more complicated, easy to break, and **slow**

send me a pm.. I'll write the formula for u.. it's just gonna be index/match with an ampersand.. a basic array formula, and given ur sheet size, shouldn't slow down ur workbook at all

suppose your first image is on sheet1, from A1 to C18, such that A1=Date and B1=Unit. The second image is on sheet2, with A2=024M and b1="Demo".

Place this formula at B2: 

    =IF(B$1=INDEX(Sheet1!$C$2:$C$18,MATCH($A2,Sheet1!$B$2:$B$18,0)),INT(INDEX(Sheet1!$A$1:$A$18,MATCH($A2&B$1,INDEX(Sheet1!$B$1:$B$18&Sheet1!$C$1:$C$18,),0))),"")

Drag across, then drag down. 

You may see just numbers, such as 42893. Just format the columns to show dates.

Others gave good solutions, that being said, if you have access Microsoft Project or other scheduling software (P6) you should really give that a try.
