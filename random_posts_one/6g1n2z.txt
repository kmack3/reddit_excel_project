Table style won't allow for font changes
So this isn't a question about formulas or anything super complicated but I can't seem to figure out what is going on. I am trying to create a custom table style as follows:

Whole Table:

 * Right, left, top, bottom, inner vertical, and inner horizontal border (thin line)
 * **Font: Arial**

Header Row:

* Bold
* Shaded
* **Font Size: 12pt**
* **Centered**

First Row Stripe:

* Size 1
* **Font Size: 11pt**

Second Row Stripe

* Size 1
* Shaded
* **Font Size: 11pt**

The bold items are the ones I am unable to add. They are grayed out when I edit my table style. I unlocked the cells but it didn't change anything.

Anyone know how to fix this?

EDIT: I'm using Excel 2010 on a Windows 7 computer
