When is a table not a table? | I'm not sure why this table like section isn't showing up as a table

I can see headings and filter buttons but I don't see a Table menu in the ribbon thingy. So is this a table?

My task is to update this document for this year. It's a budget assessment thing and I need to prepare it for this year's numbers.

This is just a regular spreadsheet with an autofilter at the top. You can select it all and convert it to a table if you prefer using Insert -> Table on the ribbon. Sometimes an autofilter is just simpler/preferable to a table.
