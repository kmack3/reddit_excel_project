Formula to Calculate skirtings & offcuts
Hi All
I have a program called bluebeam revu. With this i can measure the lengths of walls and export the data to excel. It outputs the length of each wall.

What i would like to do is, calculate how many pcs of skirting i would need to complete the project.

ie. 
- say each skirting board is 3.6m long, 
- each wall can use a maximum of 2 pcs

How would i structure something like this up so i can minimize the waste?
