How to find the number of primes between two numbers?
For example if I want to find the number of primes between 2-11 the number of primes would be 5 (2,3,5,7,11) including the numbers 2 and 11. I found an [if statement](https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/3687-excel-generate-prim-numbers.html) that would give me the list of primes within a range and I can use that to count the number of primes via VBA. I was wondering if there was an if statement that will only return the number of primes within a range?


-------------
If you're looking for a vba solution, just insert a variable that works as a counter (i = i + 1) and count the total number of primes. 

Or you can just use a formula to count the number of commas/string in the output if that's what you're looking for.

I used this as the VBA code:

Sub PrimeBetweenNumbers () 
Dim num As String  
For R = n1 To n2  
For n = Cells(R + 2, 2).Value To Cells(R + 2, 3).Value  
    For m = 2 To n - 1  
        If n Mod m = 0 Then GoTo nextstep:  
        Next m  
        Cells(R + 2, 5) = Cells(R + 2, 5) & n & ","  
nextstep:  
Next n  
Next R  
End Sub  

Then is used the LEN function to count the number of commas

However this code is very slow for very large ranges, anyway to fix that?
