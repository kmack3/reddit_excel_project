Having issues with concatenating a string and integer (integer generated with randbetween) to create a qualifier in VBA
Hello, 
I am trying to build a tic tac toe game where it is one player versus the computer. I was able to make it a two player game but my teacher asked for the computer to be a player. I am having trouble in having the computer selecting a random tile, and also I would like to make it so it dosn't select a tile that is already selected. I am trying to make it with only three tiles until i get the code down, then expand it to nine tiles, that is why you see the large comment block below the code. Thank you!!

    Private Sub button1_Click()
    Dim Random As Integer
    Dim Computer As String
    
    If Checker = False Then
    button1.Caption = "X"
    Checker = True

    Random = Application.WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(2, 9)
    Computer = "Button" & Random

    Computer.Caption = "O" 'ISSUE IS HERE
    Button"& Random &".Caption = "O" 'This doesn't work either


    'If Random = 2 Then
    'button2.Caption = "O"
    'ElseIf Random = 3 Then
    'Button3.Caption = "O"
    'ElseIf Random = 4 Then
    'Button4.Caption = "O"
    'ElseIf Random = 5 Then
    'Button5.Caption = "O"
    'ElseIf Random = 6 Then
    'Button6.Caption = "O"
    'ElseIf Random = 7 Then
    'Button7.Caption = "O"
    'ElseIf Random = 8 Then
    'Button8.Caption = "O"
    'ElseIf Random = 9 Then
    'Button9.Caption = "O"
    'End If
    End If

    button1.Enabled = False

    End Sub

I'm not sure you really need that string variable, unless you're using it for something else? Try using a select case statement.
   
    Random = WorksheetFunction.RandBetween(2, 9)
    
        Select Case Random
            Case 2: Button2.Caption = "O"
            Case 3: Button3.Caption = "O"
            Case 4: Button4.Caption = "O"
            Case 5: Button5.Caption = "O"
            Case 6: Button6.Caption = "O"
            Case 7: Button7.Caption = "O"
            Case 8: Button8.Caption = "O"
            Case 9: Button9.Caption = "O"
        End Select

    Dim Computer As String
    ...
    Computer.Caption = "O" 'ISSUE IS HERE

A string won't have a `.Caption` property
-------------
What I am trying to do is use the string to determine which button the computer will click on, so if computer = Button2 then I want Button2 to have a "O" caption, or if computer is Button3 and have Button3 to have a "O" caption. I want to avoid using Button#.Caption because then that gets rid of the random move...

As /u/_intelligentLife_ said, you can't use the .Caption property on a string.


You'll need to think about things logically. Simplistically it will be something like:


1. Think of a random number
2. Check if that button.Caption is already "X" or "O"
3. If it is, then go to step 1 (to avoid overriding)
4. If not, play move (i.e. change relevant button.Caption to "O")
