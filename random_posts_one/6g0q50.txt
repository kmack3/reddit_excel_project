Marcos all deleted and changed themselves after restarting the pc
I made a bunch of macros yesterday for work, and now they're all gone, but one that changed its own shortcut.  I have them saved as xlsb files (can't change that when creating them), and saved tlinto my personal spread sheet.  
  
Any idea what's causing them to get deleted? Is it because they aren't saving as xlsm? If so, how do I do that?  
  
Thanks in advance!


-------------
If they saved to "Personal.xlsb", you probably either forgot to save or deleted them on accident.

Yeah... I realized I was clicking "dont save" at the end when closing excelðŸ˜©
