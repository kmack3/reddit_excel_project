Question about macro filtering large amounts of data using conditional formatting.
Hello Reddit:

I am trying to use an Excel (2016) Macro to filter a large amount of data for my dissertation. In a nutshell, I am looking at text occurrences over 20 years. Thus, for each journal I am studying, I have twenty different sheets with the text occurrences. As I’m doing this for multiple text occurrences and multiple journals, I have a lot of data to sort.

**Here is what I need to do:**

* Filter relevant cells (that contain specific text occurrence) to top
* Randomize relevant cells
* Pick random 25 relevant cells and move to a different workbook (for the second level of analysis)

**Here is what I’ve tried:**

* Conditionally formatting for text occurrence (ex: keyword “student”)
* Filter conditionally formatted to top (usually by cell color)
* =Rand() on Col A
* Filter smallest-largest
* Cut/copy top 25 and drop in new workbook

**Here’s what doesn’t work:**

I would like to do this all in one action as I have thousands of occurrences I have to parcel through. However, when I set up and run my macro to do run it, **it does not filter by conditional format.** 

It will run fine when I set up the macro, but when I try and apply it to a new sheet, no filtering happens. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/IvYZY) is an image of running the macro in a second sheet. As you can see, the macro fails to filter the relevant cells to the top.
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated. I am not knowledgeable at VBA, but could figure some things out. 

Here is the Macro I’m working with (sorry it is messy). It is also incomplete because I have my move data to another worksheet macro as separate.

Replace every instance of "Worksheets("Sheet14")" with "ActiveSheet" and see where that gets you.

Thanks for replying!

It throws the error:
    Run-time error '9':
    Subscript out of range

When throwing the "Run-time error '9': Subscript out of range" error, [here](http://imgur.com/a/kv4D5) is the part of code it highlights as the issue.

Sorry I wasn't clear, you need to replace the entire phrase "Worksheets("Sheet14")" with "ActiveSheet", i.e.  

    ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Sort.SortFields.Clear 

This makes the code run on whatever sheet you have open, rather than Sheet14.


"ActiveWorkbook" isn't really necessary either but you can keep it if you want.

> ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet.Sort.SortFields.Clear 

Aha! That worked! Thank you SO much. This has been driving me insane for awhile now. The rest of the process should go relatively smoothly from here on out. Thank you /u/pancak3d, I appreciate your patience and help.
