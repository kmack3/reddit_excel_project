Combining Validation Lists
I created two cells with a Validation List. One with client number (cell A) and the other one with the products (cell B) that are available for all customers.
So when I'm searching I first need to fill in a number and than I need to search in the cell B list between all possible products for the correct product. And that combination creates an Customer_Product ID.

But I want to create that when I put in cell A an contract number that in cell B only the products that are specifically available for that contract number are visible. So that I don't need to go through all the products each time I change a contract number.

I unfortunately don't have screenshots available at this moment. 

But when you don't understand what I mean, let me know!

You can do this with named ranges. See this tutorial:
