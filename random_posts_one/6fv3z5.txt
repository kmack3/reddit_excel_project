Determine if any cell in a list of dates overlaps a range of dates
Looking to determine if any occurrences of an event overlap a list of date ranges. Everything I've searched for online only helps me with checking against a single date range.

So in the end, the question I'd like to ask for each cell in Column A is "Does this event overlap any of the ranges in Columns B and C?"

Thanks so much!

To count how many dates A1 is in the middle of column B and column C, you can use this formula: 

    =COUNTIFS($B$1:$B$20,"<"&A1,$C$1:$C$20,">"&A1)

But to get a true/false answer, put this formula in D1 and drag down: 

    =COUNTIFS($B$1:$B$20,"<"&A1,$C$1:$C$20,">"&A1)>1

How about

    =COUNTIFS(B:B, "<="&A1, C:C, ">="&A1)>0

Result will be true/false to indicate it is in one of the ranges.

Thanks for your help. /u/CFAman's solution worked.

ok. the above formula should have been >0, not >1

Thanks so much, this worked great.
