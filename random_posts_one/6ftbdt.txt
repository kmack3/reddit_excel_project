Clash analysis
Hello,

I work in a school and I'm trying to find which students have a clash of subjects in order to build a clash-free exam timetable. I can export the data from our database to Excel but I've hit a wall as I can't seem to achieve what I want with a pivot table.

Column A contains the students unique ID and column B contains the subject name. Each student has a separate row for as many subjects as they take. I want to see which subjects "share" students and which are mutually exclusive. I could compare class lists with vlookup but this would be quite tedious.

Hopefully someone can help.

If i understand you in the right way, you may have to drag down the unique student ID in values, and the subjects into rows?

A few questions:

* Does each student have the same number of total classes?
* Is there a blank row between students?
* Are you comfortable using macros/VBA?

It would really help to have a better idea of the layout of your worksheet.

-------------
Could we get a screen capture of the layout?

What factors are already determined and on the spreadsheet?

* Student Schedule
* Exam Start time
* Exam End time
* Passing time(time between classes)

To have an easy visualization, I would use conditional formatting for this. I can't give you a formula without knowing that other info though.

I don't understand why you can't pivot? 
-------------
I already have the unique ID in each row if that's what you mean? So each row has a student ID and class name, with student IDs having as many rows as the student has corresponding classes.

Here's a demo. Not great with macros/VBA but could give it a go.
