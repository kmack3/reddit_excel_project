If I open a file from explorer, Excel opens but the worksheet does not appear.
As the title states, I'm having an issue where if I open a file from Windows Explorer (say, by double clicking), the program opens but there is no workbook open. Most of the options are grayed out, and it's not as if the file is just open off screen. I am using Excel 2010.



This happens with any file I try, so it seems to be the program itself. I am able to open files FROM Excel by either dragging them into the program or going File > Open, but that's an irritating workaround.

Is there something easy I'm missing? I googled some options but nothing seemed to work.

Try running install and repair installation.
