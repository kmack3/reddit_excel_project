Creating a template for basic data analysis
Hi, I am creating a template for my professor who is collecting data via surveys for a research project. I would like the template to provide basic data analysis such as max, min, mean, median, stdev etc. however, I do not know the expected sample size so my issue now lies in the fact that I have just select a large amount of cells as my range.

This is a problem for 4 out of the 5 functions that I would like to use so I was wondering if there is a way to code my template such that it only takes into consideration cells with input.

In other words, I don't want null cells (0) being included in the sample size and returning under-estimations for functions like mean or min.

I have considered using 'countif' to help in determining sample size but that doesn't really solve the issue of only selecting the cells with input for calculations.

Thank you!

Try to use a sumif function.  Set your criteria to >0

Ah, I found away around it using a combination of array and if formulas. Thanks for the help.
