Is there a function to identify data in variable [X], then numerically rank duplicate data based on variable [Y]?
Problem I am trying to solve is: create column that gives the # of the videogame release by date.

For example: there are three dates for same videogame:  
2/2/2002, 3/3/2013, 4/4/2014  

the row with 4/4/2014 should have a '3'   
3/3/2013 should have a '2'   
and 2/2/2002 should have a '1'

If there is a single entry for a videogame, it should only have '1'

I think that is part of the function needed. Not sure if I managed to explain it well though - here is a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/6wkwe). So essentially what I would need is a function that would put a "1" next to Arclight, and then a "1' next to the first Beyblade date and a "2" next to the second Beyblade date.
