non-duplicate and find them out
Currently i have a list about 10k of digit numbers, how do i find the non-duplicate list from column A using the data from column B ?

example , in column B i have around 4k row of numbers, and i wanted to remove all the 4k numbers at column A means (10k-4k=6k) it will be have 6k rows of digit on column A only


-------------
On column C:

    =MATCH(B1,A$1:A$10000,0)

Then just filter rows with numbers in column C and delete them all.

Edit:
To prevent blank cells issues.

    =IF(NOT(ISBLANK(B1)),MATCH(B1,A$1:A$10000,0),NA())
