How to sort columns based off another column?
Hello I'm pretty new to excel and I am stuck. I want to rank all the 188 countries by their listing on the Human development index. 

[Here is what the first few parts of the data looks like](http://i.imgur.com/zalwffb.png) 

[And this is what it should look like, but for all 188 countries](http://i.imgur.com/qCz76j7.png)

Thank you

Highlight all the columns. Click sort under the data tab. in sort by pick the column labeled HDI Rank. In sort on choose values. In order choose Z to A. And it should sort all the highlighted columns by the HDI in descending order.
