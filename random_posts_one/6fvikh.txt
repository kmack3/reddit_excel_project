How can I stop formulas from changing when I sort?
Aloha, I've been working on a small project to help rank houses objectively.  The problem I have is that when I try to sort by score (data, sort) the formulas change automatically and have to be rewritten. 

Is there a way I can sort without the formulas changing? Also, is there a way to fill in the formulas in New cells (dragging to new cells also automatically changes the formulas? I want row 3 (the weighed score) to be used in every row, while it updates the score for each house automatically (row 6 and up)

Thanks!

Have you tried enclosing the cell values in dollar signs? For example, if your formula referenced cell C4, it would look like $C$4. This will lock the formula onto that cell. You can either manually type the dollar signs, or press F4 to apply them while your cursor is inside a cell value.

What formula is in A6?

Use tables and lock the weighting values like this  $C$3...

Here's the conversion I made for you:

Cheers mate.

Sure thing! Thanks again, I like the color coding you included

It's called conditional formatting. I select the whole *table* column, Home -> Conditional formatting -> choose one you fancy.
