Formula request to strip out an XY Axis graph to a specific template with consistent changing values.
I may have overwhelmed myself trying to find the right formula for this.

I have a sheet of data that I need to format to a specific template.

This is the template

As you can see the values of sizes, qty's and names are everchanging which is where I am falling over with my VLOOKUP's. 

I have tried to follow the rules and researched the net and sidebar FAQ, post history etc as much as possible but I may have missed something and apologies if I have. 

Thank you.
