Building Key Performance Indicators (KPI's) Dashboard from database link. Would like to capture trends. Possible to do without VBA?
We have a SQL database that I am able to pull data from in Excel using Data > From Other Sources > From Microsoft Query.  I'm looking to build a KPI Dashboard (KPIs are essentially a corporate report card) that includes data and graphs that show both current state and trends.  Current state is easy, I can build what I want from the tables and just Refresh All when I need an update.  What is the best way to capture this data on a periodic basis and log it in order to build graphs to display trends?  Can it be automated?  I imagine it will take some VBA to automate.  I'm not proficient in VBA (yet), so if there's a way to do it without, that'd be great.

Thank you.

Am no expert and have no clue about sql sources. 
My opinion would be to extract the data, put it into a data table on one sheet, then create a or multiple pivot tables from this data table. 

This way, when the data table updates it will be included into the pivot tables and also update the charts you made from that data. 

The only issue left is to make the data table automatically be populated from the sql data, which I'm not sure how it's done.
