Covert PowerPivot Pivot Table
Hi, 

I have a Pivot Table that pulls from a data model generated from a SQL query.  I’d like to preserve the Pivot Table (all column headers are the same) and switch the source from the SQL data table to a table within the workbook.  I’ve added the workbook table to the data model, however, when I try to switch the data source I get the following error:  “You cannot choose a connection that is incompatible with the existing connection.” 

Is there a way to do this?   

Or am I forced to rebuild the Pivot Table?    

The Pivot Table is heavily formatted, so for time’s sake, I hoping not to have to rebuild it.  

Thanks in advance!
