Need some help making a total from multiplying by a quantity

Here is the thing I'm trying to do but I can't seem to figure out how to make it have a subtotal by looking at what quantity there is. I don't know any excel but really need this for work so any help would be greatly appreciated.


-------------
Basic formula will be like:

    =SUMPRODUCT(PriceRange, QtyRange)

So, the top left one might be:

    =SUMPRODUCT(B4:B9, C4:C9)

Thanks will try it now :)

One other thing. The hope is to have this running on a tablet where I can tick off the things I need and have a separate shopping list with a total cost created. Is that possible?


Edit: It says Err:508 when I use that formula.
-------------
The formula results in saying "Err:508"? Or it won't let you confirm the formula at all. Possible ideas are that your system uses semicolons instead of commas to separate arguements:

    =SUMPRODUCT(B4:B9; C4:C9)

Or, are you using Google Sheets and the function is not supported (idk, just guessing)?
-------------
Ah I tried using semi colon and it worked haha

I have values in A2:A3  and B1:C1. So two rows and two columns of values.

I just used
    =SUMPRODUCT(A2:A3,B1:C1)

But that's giving a value error. Can you not use it going two ways?

-------------
Phew, that was the easier solution. :)

Mind replying with "Solution Verified" to give me a ClippyPoint, and the bot will change this thread's flair?

We can, but I don't think it'll do what you want. You can force the multiplication by this:

     =SUMPRODUCT((A2:A3)*(B1:C1))

But, this doesn't do equivalent of `A2*B1 + A3*C1`. Instead, it does something like this: `A2*B1+A2*C1+A3*B1+A3*C1`
