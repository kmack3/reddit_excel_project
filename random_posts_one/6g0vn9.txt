I cannot open an excel file directly from the browser.
I was easily opening files from the file browser by double clicking the excel file in Office 2010.

I recently bought Office/Excel 2016, and now I cannot open a file from the browser, and I have to open Excel first and open the file from there which is not very practical. When I double click the file on the browser, Excel opens, but the file does not open.

I could not find a related settings change. There is no such problem with MS Word 2016.

Does anybody have a suggestion?

Regards, thanks.

Try running the installation and choose Repair.

Do you still have 2010 installed?  I had the same problem when I had multiple versions of excel installed.

I reinstalled. And solved. Thanks.
