Conditional formatting using a rule, how do I lock the cell for the columns, but not for the rows?
This may be a very simple question, but I haven't been able to google it correctly. I'm trying to make a conditional formatting so that the complete row is painted in red when the H cell reads "CANCELED". 

The problem is that I can't do it unless I lock the cell in the formula, and if I lock the cell, I can't drag it down because the next row's formatting depends on the first one's "CANCELED" status.

Thanks for the help!





-------------
Add formula rule at the first row first cell , example add at A2

`=$H2="cancelled"` select format when TRUE

Then `Apply to` the rest of the range to colour. e.g A2:H5000

To add to what /u/excelevator said, the dollar signs in a cell reference lock the column/row independently. So, you can have A1, $A1, A$1, and $A$1 as example of different relative/absolute combinations.
