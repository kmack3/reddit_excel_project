Filter crashes 2013, works fine in 2010

Hi all,

Hope you can help! I have a pretty big spreadsheet, 37mb. There are filters already set up on each column, although nothing selected in each. In Office 2013 when you try and filter a 'date' column it crashes, when I pick 2015 - October for example. Applying the same filter in 2010 works fine. 

In Excel 2013 the bottom shows Calculating (4 processors) : 0%. Any time I click it goes to not responding. In Excel 2010 the % rises very quickly.

I'm assuming it is something that has changed in 2013, but can't find any help through googling! Maybe I'm searching the wrong thing.

I've checked Add-Ons, tried Safe Mode, and tried saving as different file formats, no luck!


-------------
I found 2013 to be really buggy, I switched back to 2010.

I don't use it that much, but this is the first thing I've encountered that makes me miss 2010. Hope there's some solution somewhere!
