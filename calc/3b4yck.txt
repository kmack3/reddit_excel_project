Sorting a large dataset by a drop-down list

I have a question about sorting that I have not been able to find the answer to. Using Excel 2010

My problem: I would like to sort a large table ('Participant Table'!A1:AG47638) based on a value of around 50 different values in drop down list ('Choose your Location'!G7), which matches values in 'Participant Table'!I:I

I have been successful using a third sheet to copy the people I need using and array index formula, but due to the size it takes a LONG time to compute, and is not useful:

=IFERROR(INDEX('Participant Table'!D$2:D$47638,SMALL(IF('Choose your Location'!$G$7='Participant Table'!$J$2:$J$47638,ROW('Participant Table'!$J$2:$J$47638)-MIN(ROW('Participant Table'!$J$2:$J$47638))+1,""),ROW('Participant Table'!A1))),"")


Does anybody have a solution that would require less resources? I think vba is the route to go but I've never used it so I'm ignorant in it's use but am very open to it if somebody can walk me through a bit- I would say that I'm an intermediate user. 

Thank you SO much in advance.

I'm a big fan of Access if only to make queries and import or link them to excel to save the smaller/quick calculations for Excel. It's really not that hard to learn. I had an excel dashboard that took 30 minutes to calculate and I minimized the calculating time greatly by doing the long calculations with Access.

Can you try to make a first column that finds the row you are looking to reference (say 341), and then use that inside your INDEX functions?

This way, you only calculate the row you are looking at once per line, instead of once per cell. Does that make sense?

You would be better bringing your data into powerpivot then using slicers and a pivot table to issolate data selected. From this you can also create DAX formulas to provide key metrics that could be pushed to a chart/dashboard for the end user. Powerpivot can handle millions of rows and will be quicker and take less resources.

Hi for those interested I found a sufficient solution to my example that populates a third sheet.

I should have included in my description. I'm attempting to distribute the workbook as a tool to others and I'm unsure of if they'll have anything besides Excel. I'm trying to keep it all within one worksheet and as user friendly as possible. 

But your option does peak my own curiosity. I've never used Access actually.
-------------
Interesting I'm not sure I understand the row function, could you link an example?
-------------
From my understanding slicers are not in Excel 2010. Is that incorrect?
-------------
Can you simplify the data by linking just the values into a separate workbook and then using a pivot table? Or are they going to be updating this for their own needs and need the formulas?

Clippy: ROW

They will be changing the value in the drop down menu, which is what I've conceptualized as the search criteria

Just a a quick heads up, the reddit spam filter removes any shortened URLs, so you may want to steer away from them.

[ROW](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/ROW-function-3A63B74A-C4D0-4093-B49A-E76EB49A6D8D)

     Syntax: ROW(reference)


Returns the row number of a reference.

Well that is the [actual URL](http://my.cl.ly/), not a shortened one...
Do I need an URL lengthener?

Oh, odd... nope just your post was caught in the spam filter and that url looked odd, but all is well...
