Excel 2011 on Mac crashes on Pivot Table refresh

I posted this on mrexcel, but I didn't get any responses. Maybe you guys know what the solution is.
 
My problem is just like the title says. I have a fairly large amount of data reporting into a pivot table. I made this on windows and it works perfectly fine. I sent it over to someone with a Mac (their excel is fully updated), and after they modify the source data and try to refresh the pivot table, Excel crashes. This does not happen when I do the same thing on my computer running windows.  I did some searching, and it seems that a lot of people have had this issue, but I haven't been able to find a solution for it. Anyone know what I should do?

Thanks!

P.S. I'm running excel 2010 version: 14.0.6129.5000

Unfortunately, although 2011 is better than 2008, Excel for Mac is a fairly shameful product that borders on useless if you have a large amount of data.  That being said you could try changing the file from XLS to XLSX (or vice versa) and upgrade your version of Excel to 2013.

I work with Excel on a Mac and it can be fairly unstable at times.  How much Ram do you have?  We solved some excel stability issues for some machines in the office by upping the Ram.

You can run the windows version of office on a Mac with parallels.

Not sure how much ram the Mac has, it's my boss', and he's not in the office.

Also bootcamp which I find more stable

About 20,000 cells, many of which have formulas.

Thanks, I'll give that a shot. I would love it if I could tell my boss to buy a real computer though... :)
