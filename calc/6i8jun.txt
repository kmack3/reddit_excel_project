Need an alternative to Index/Match with multiple criteria (array formula)
I am having some trouble performing a lookup with index/match using multiple criteria when it is an array formula. I have 2 workbooks, one with 500,000 rows (this one contains the value I want to lookup) and the other has 300,000 rows. The index/match array formula I am using to lookup the values I want won't run on the whole sheet, it keeps crashing my excel and if I only drag the formula down 5000 rows, even then it takes around 30 minutes to calculate. 



Are there any alternatives I could use to lookup a value using multiple criteria? 



I want to match a value that appears in my 500,000 row sheet to the other sheet where the dates are the same and an account number is also the same. 



The formula i'm using looks something like this:



    Index(ColumnInBook1, Match(DateInBook2&AccountNumInBook2,  
    DateColumnInBook1&AccountColumnInBook1, 0))



If you need any other information please let me know. Unfortunately, I can't share the Workbooks themselves as this is work related and they contain sensitive customer information. I am open to using VBA to accomplish this, if anyone knows how to put that kind of code together. 

Thanks for any and all help :) 


-------------
My trick in situations where I need an index/match with multiple criteria is to create helper columns in the both arrays of data that are concatenations of the criteria.  So if I'm looking up against criteria in column A and B, I'll make a temporary column that is "colAcolB" and then make sure my match column in the other array is in the same format.  Much much faster than an Index/Match with multiple criteria.
-------------
If the returned value is a number, try

    =SUMPRODUCT((DateCol=Date)*(AcctCol=Acct)*ColumnInBook1)

If it's not a number

    =INDEX(ColumnInBook1, SUMPRODUCT((DateCol=Date)*(AcctCol=Acct)*(ROW(DateCol)-X+1))

where `X` is the row number of the first data point.

If you have datasets that large you really want to be using a database, not Excel. I would look into Power Query aka Get And Transform, which adds database-like options to Excel. There are lots of great tutorials on Youtube etc - look for one about merging tables.

Sorry for taking so long to get back to you. I tried this method and it was significantly faster and eventually worked for me without my Excel crashing (although it still took around 30 minutes to run), thank you :) 

I also found pasting the data all into 1 workbook helped to speed it up as well, rather than referencing another workbook.

-------------
The value is a not a number, its letters from A - F. 


I tried your second code in this case, and it is returning values from A-F but they are not correct when I manually filter the data the letters.

This is how I entered the formula in my sheet:

    =INDEX('[New Segment Data from 
    March.xlsx]Sheet1'!$U:$U,SUMPRODUCT(('[New Segment Data from 
    March.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A:$A=E2)*('[New Segment Data from 
    March.xlsx]Sheet1'!$L:$L=N2)*(ROW('[New Segment Data from 
    March.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A:$A)-2+1)))


Where: [New Segment Data from March.xlsx]Sheet1'!$U:$U is the value I want to return. 


[New Segment Data from March.xlsx]Sheet1'!$A:$A is the column that contains the dates in the lookup workbook


E2 is the date in the workbook that I want to match against the lookup workbook. 


[New Segment Data from  March.xlsx]Sheet1'!$L:$L is the column that contains the accout number in the lookup workbook. 


N2 is the account number I want to match against in the lookup workbook. 


For X i entered 2 since my data starts on row 2, the first row is headers.

2 is good, but then select from row 2 downwards. There's no reason to select the whole column unless you have data in all million+ rows - it's only going to slow things down. So change your full column references to something like `L$2:L$50000`. 

If you do want to keep using full columns, use X=1.
-------------
You mean instead of selecting $U:$U use $U2:$U500000?

Would the 2 at the end always be 2, or should it change to 3, 4, 5, etc...as I drag the formula down?

Edit: Sorry looks like you added more to your comment after I posted this so I didn't see it immediately.
