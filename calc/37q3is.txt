Countif formula crashes Excel when trying to Copy/Paste values

First time posting here, I guess I need help with more of an efficiency issue than writing a formula. I am writing a countif formula that the criteria range gets bigger the further down the page it gets copied. I need this because I have a list of part numbers that have been ordered over the last year, but they can have orders placed for the same part number multiple times in a month. I have to assign Point of Sale data to the part number for a Pivot chart and I cant have the sales duplicated multiple times. I figured if I wrote something like

=Countifs(A$1:A1,A1,B$1:B1,B1)

Where column A is the part number and Column B is the month. This way I can only assign the POS data to the "ones". The formula works as designed, but when I try to copy paste values my Excel freezes and does not come back. I am running 64 bit Excel 2013. I have 24 GB of RAM and I have a Xeon 6 core processor dual threaded. Should this be happening? Is there a better way to do this? Thanks for your help!

How many rows are we talking about?

How about sorthing data by date and using countif only for last 100 rows?

E.g a1000=countifs(A900:A1000,a1000,B900:B1000,B1000)?

That way you can cut a lot of computation out of it. Of course 100 is number pulled out of the hat.

392000

Is column B in chronological order? i.e. do you really need to go all the way back to row 1 even when you're in the thousands?

I sorted the file by part number. Then I sort it by Month, oldest to newest.

So if you sorted by month second, that would mean the data is in month order. I don't know how many sales per each month you have but if you just estimate it at 1000, I would do something like this for row 2000:

    =COUNTIFS(A1000:A3000,A2000,B1000:B3000,B2000)

and drag that down.

You could use this because of the boundary issues:

    =COUNTIFS(INDIRECT("A"&max(1,row(A1)-1000)&":A"&row(A1)),A1,INDIRECT("B"&max(1,row(B1)-1000)&":B"&row(B1)),B1)

Unfortunately the amount of lines by part by month is variable month to month. I dont think i can put in a static range and have it apply to all the different amount of month's data

It took a while to calculate but it worked. I didn't think to limit the size of the range as I went down. Thank you very much!!

What is the month with the most? Take my edited formula above and change the "-1000"s to whatever is worst, 10,000, 20,000....
