Excel filtering slow in same file on one computer, not another?

I have two high-end computers. i7-3840QM CPU @ 2.80GHz, 16GB RAM, etc. Both have 64Bit Office (2016). The computers resources are not hitting above 20% during this filtering.

When filtering in the excel sheet on one computer it takes maybe 15-30 seconds. On the other, the one I need it to work on, it takes anywhere between 10 and 15 minutes. The exact same filtering. The excel file IS large, but it works fine on one computer, just not the other.

I have moved the file from the network to the local computer.

I changed the Office version from 32bit to 64.

I made sure there were no Windows or Office updates left uninstalled.
