Slow to open a sheet with 5 million rows

What aspect of my PC do I need to upgrade if my excel sheet takes forever to load? Is it RAM? The processor? Thanks in advance!

I might be wrong, but I've been put under the impression that this isn't a limitation of your PC, but rather a limitation of Microsoft Office. If you're using 5 million rows, you might want to consider switching to like a SQL database or something a little more hefty than excel.
-------------
Wait. I thought Excel tops off at 2^20 (1,048,576) rows?

Opening even 100,000 rows is enough to make the latest version of Excel, on the latest PC with the fastest 32GB RAM and SSD choke.

Try importing it into access. Excel limits you to just over a million rows

I'm going to second this. I know I don't like to mess with more than 100k rows due to the instability I encounter.

If you're exporting from a database, I'd export as a CSV text file, and then use the query feature in excel to add that to your data model and then setup a pivot table from there.

You might be right - in asking for my bro who doesn't use Reddit. He could have easily exaggerated when he gave me the row count

Yes, this exactly. I don't mean to sound like an echo chamber but I've run into some major issues with spreadsheets that go above 100k rows.
