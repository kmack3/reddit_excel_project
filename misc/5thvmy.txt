Excel Power Query for Facebook Information in large quantities

I'm looking to take a list of FB profiles I have and scrape all the publically available information like name, location, workplace etcetera.  It's a rather large list for a group I own but I wanted to see if I could get the metrics through the Power Query function in Excel.  

I found how to do it manually, but I've been at a loss at how to create a function in a cell that I could drag down for my 4k+ entries in this list.  




-------------
Can I suggest PowerBI? It's got built in sources for most data types, including Facebook, and can handle large data really well.

I looked whether it was possible with PQ - but it's not obvious what OP wants to achieve.
