[Need help] Randomly can't add data to open worksheets? Worksheet "freezes".

So often times I'll have 3 or 4 separate worksheets open.  They're pretty data intensive, often times having 10,000 or more rows of data.  

About a half dozen times a day, I'll be entering data into a sheet and my keystrokes will just not be registering anything in the sheet.  I'm still able to navigate on the worksheet, switch tabs, etc., but I can't add anything.  

Sometimes this is "fixed" by going to a different tab, then back to the one I was working on.  Other times I have to close the document completely.

This happens mostly when I have multiple spreadsheets open, but sometimes also happens when I only have one open.  It seems to happen at random with no warning signs.

FWIW, I use the 2013 version.

Try turning off AutoSave if you haven't already.

Hmm how much RAM does your computer have and what version of Office are you running (32 or 64).

Try doing a repair on Office since sometimes this can fix any weird issues if you ever updated office, etc: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b

Do you restart your computer everyday or do you constantly leave it on?
