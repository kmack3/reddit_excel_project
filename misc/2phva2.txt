Splitting an excel file that is too large to open

Is there a way to split an excel file that is too large to open? 
I can't open it without excel crashing.
I figured I might split it into a few files to lessen the load.
File size: 5,080,817 KB


-------------
If possible, try importing the Excel file into Access

How did you come to have such an absurdly large file, in the first place?
-------------
Have you tried to open it with Excel 64-bit?
-------------
You could connect the excel file to a PowerPivot model and extract the data.

Change extension to  .zip and then unzip it, split up the xml into similar structured file packages for each worksheet, and then rezip and change back to .xlsx  


I make no promises that this will work in the slightest 
-------------
I believe the maximum size of mdb or accdb file is 2GB.

Try importing to SqlServer or other DB.

Not sure if I'm running the 64 or 32. How can I check?

It's a kind of funny coincidence. I posted that link 10 minutes before testhec10ck's question :)

How would I go about doing this?
-------------
I've never even gotten close to this, but it looks like you're right!

Yup, that's what I thought.  :D
-------------
Honestly, digging around and experimentation. I haven't unzipped an xlsx file for awhile and don't even remember what the structure looks like

Definitely not for the faint hearted :)

Maybe I inspired his/her question. Who knows ;)

First solution in my mind is to use other programming language (python with pandas or xlrd comes to mind) to read the xlsx.



Then I read other suggestion to import the file to database server or using PowerPivot (both seems to be a better solution than try to do with programming language)



But your suggestion sir is the most hardcore of them all :p .

Renaming to zip file, extract all the worksheet in folder xl\worksheet, split all the xml and then parse or create xslt for the xml? 

The satisfaction when you done it will be truly epic.
