Power Query performance issue - upvote fix for known problem.
Power Query / Get Data in Excel has a known issue that slows down performance.  If you've ever built a workbook that has dependent queries, this issue affects you.  The same M code will execute 7 to 15 times faster in Power BI than it will in excel because of this issue.  

I've been working around this issue for some time now and willing to help if you have having similar issues.  Please help me get this issue fixed by going to Microsoft User Voice and upvoting the issue:
