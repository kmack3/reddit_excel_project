/r/Excel advice thread repository
> Google[42] - Seriously, 75+% of the answers you receive have been googled for you.

Shhh, Let us pretend like we all know everything.. ;)
sticky dis! 
I was noticing this trend, too. Good idea of compiling a lot of these answers. Definitely deserves a sticky or a link in the sidebar.
Could we possibly add [this one](http://www.rondebruin.nl/win/s1/outlook/mail.htm) to the list? I know you have Ron de Bruin up there already, but lots of people wonder about sending emails in Excel and this is my favorite tutorial about that.
oh, not to be pushy, but in bedtime reading, maybe add this link on improving calculation performance, it is a question that comes up from time to time and I think the article is long enough to qualify lol:

Another thought is maybe add a few keywords to the external sites if applicable, like 

Petiertech (Charts)  
Excel Exposure (Online Excel training course)  
CPearson (Macro utilities and addins)  

I mean it's never going to be 100% correct, but maybe to give people a general idea of which link to click to be most likely to find what they're looking for.

Edit: Btw awesome job compiling all of this!
Brilliant post, /u/Fishrage_, thank you!
Threads on using external websites crop up several times a week.  This one is recent and gives a good example of using excel to access the USPS database to query shipping cost and package tracking.  I'm not specifically suggesting this thread, rather that a category of "querying websites into excel" might be useful.

Any chance of considering my site for this list? It has around two hours (and growing) of videos teaching people ways to use Excel. It's all free and there's no signup required. I spend a lot of time preparing the videos and am keen to see if people start finding them useful.

[Excel Financial Modelling](http://excelfinancialmodelling.com) - Excel Training

For books of an advanced nature I would suggest Professional Excel Development by Rob Bovey http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0321508793?pc_redir=1410755562&robot_redir=1
ExcelVBAisFun YouTube channel - I don't see it here...

Please add :)

And be sure to re-sticky ;)
Is there any way to save and/or upload an excel workbook to 2 different sharepoints? Even if I could just have a way to do it to one that would be great...one requires 'check out', the other doesn't. 

I recently inherited this...I run a macro to update a workbook from a (third) sharepoint and then have to re-upload it to sharepoints 1 & 2 and it just seems convoluted to me :/

Along these same lines, is it just me, or does this subreddit rarely show up when Google is searched for Excel questions? Even if I type in a question verbatim, I feel like it wouldn't show up in Google results. I guess it's more of a reddit problem than an /r/Excel problem, but just something odd I've noticed.
Done.

Thank you.  Added.

I see you submitted a post about this, sometimes it takes some time to get some response.
I believe that it's a Reddit issue.
That's what I was thinking, as well. I'm usually surprised to find any link to reddit (even original reddit content) on the first page of Google search results. I only have a brief understanding of how Google's search engine works, but I feel like this should be fixed, but that's just me.

Put simply, Google 'scans' your website to find 'things' (keywords, phrases, videos etc).  The more 'things' it finds, the higher up you'll be in the search.  HOWEVER... If you spam your website with keywords, phrases, videos etc then you will be penalised.  Of course there are exceptions to this. 

The main issue I can see with Reddit is that it isn't a 'forum' (?) designed for 1 thing like MrExcel/ExcelForum etc.  Therefore it makes it hard to Google to bump it up the list.

Please note, I have no idea what I'm talking about and this is pure speculation.
I imagine also that the thread title would be the relevant item google would display and in 90% of cases, the user doesn't write it in a way that highlights what the answer turns out to be. 
(Not their fault - its inherent in the asking for help obviously)
But the same is true for the other forums (MrExcel, ExcelForum etc).
