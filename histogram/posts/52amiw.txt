How can I transfer data from a website into Excel?
Download Power Query from Microsoft and then go to the button in the ribbon called  "get data from website".
Would you consider VBA a viable option?
Try opening in IE, click on the table (if it is one) and open in excel. 

You can also use the data tab (I think) to get it from websites if it's in a table. 
You can with iMacros or WIN Automation.
