Make graphs display empty cells as gaps and not zeros
Put  #N/A in the empty cells to get them to appear as gaps
Try putting the formula =NA() into the blank cells, this puts a value of #N/A, which excel will then output as gaps in the graph.  It's not pretty in the datasheet, but it works.
Are you sure the blank cells are actually blank?  Is there a chance that they actually have a space in them?

There's a guy in my company that clears cells using the space bar instead of backspace or delete.  He's occasionally the bane of my existence when I'm trying to format things nicely.
Is this a scatter plot with lines added? If so try a line graph with line points shown. These act differently.
Paint the color of the missing data points as transparent
This! Took me forever to figure out. I switched from 2003 (which treats blanks as blanks) to 2010 (which treats blanks as 0 on graphs) recently at work, and little changes like that are infuriating! 
Yep this works! It screws up other numbers being calculated, but as for the graph it works! Thanks for the help!

I'll try this when i get to work tomorrow and post my results! Thanks for the help!
This works too, putting =NA() or just #N/A works. It breaks calculating averages or Max/Min but the graph works

I just double checked that. I selected the supposed blank cells and used the 'clear all' tool which should do the trick. 

The Graph still shows the blank cells as zero.
This is a graph with three scatter plots, and two linear trend lines on the blue and green data sets
Great! Can you help with ClippyPoints by replying with "Solution Verified"?

Thanks
I think you have to have #n/a for gaps instead of blanks.
Yes, So change it to a line graph instead of a scatter plot this should then skip the blanks for you.
That makes my graph look way off.
