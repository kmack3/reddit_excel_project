VBA Date Filter
Your Date1 and Date2 variables are just going to return true/false in the above code. Essentially the way you have it written Date1/Date2 are checking whether the number format in that cell is mm/dd/yyyy. Also you'd want to remove the quotes around your variable names when setting the filter range. Give this a shot: 

    Sub Macro2()
    
    Dim Date1 As String
    Dim Date2 As String
    
    Date1 = Format(Sheets("Sheet1").Range("G2").Value, "mm/dd/yyyy")
    Date2 = Format(Sheets("Sheet1").Range("H2").Value, "mm/dd/yyyy")
    
    ActiveWorkbook.SlicerCaches("NativeTimeline_Date").ClearDateFilter
    ActiveWorkbook.SlicerCaches("NativeTimeline_Date").TimelineState. _
        SetFilterDateRange Date1, Date2
    
    End Sub

Solution Verified!  
    Sometimes you need to step back and have someone else find your error hahaha, I was looking at it for a while and could not for the life of me figure it out!  Thank you
