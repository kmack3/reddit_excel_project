I have dates in format 2017/dayofyear/HH:MM:SS, how do I extract the day of the year?
If string in A1 `=MID(A1,6,LEN(A1)-14)`
If the data is an actual date and not a string you can use =DAY(data).
Thanks I'll try this. 
It's not an actual date. Thanks though. 
Please change the question flair to Solved if you have your answer.
I will, I haven't had the chance to try it yet.
