I wrote Excel tutorials full of gif, and I'm looking for feedback!
Added as a bookmark , only looked at 2 or 3 but learned some tips that as a half decent excel user (macro's and VB edits) didnt know.

Gonna have a look another time sober for more tips, thanks.
Add index match as a subset to vlookup. Seeing a gif of it will definitely explain it better than just seeing the formula! 
Wow, been using excel heavily for the last year and already learned a ton from your site. Well done!
This is a great way to teach excel. I'm definitely bookmarking to visit back when you get more. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say this but you should visit some of the other excel resource sites and basically follow their lesson plans and translate into gifs. There are many sites for excel tips and tricks but putting them into gif in my opinion is a huge added benefit for people like me that value the visual aid piece. 
That's a brilliant idea. Checking it out right now thanks for the effort.
You have earned a bookmark and I am looking forward to future posts. I'm looking for analytic jobs right now and this is very helpful in brushing up on my excel skills. Thank you.
Interesting content displayed very attractively. 

I noticed in your REF error section you have **past** as a typo rather than **paste** by the way.
Very nice! Simple and comprehensive.  With your permission I am going to recommend this to my users. (about 3000 of them) and put the link to my weekly "Tips and Tricks" section. Would love to see more. 

If I may add my 2 cents. My users often create nested IFs instead of using And(), OR() functions within IF. If you are planning to add updates to that section, IMHO that would be useful addition. 
Do you have tips for VBA?
Very nice. Very well done.  

I consider myself somewhat advanced in excel and learned something on the first page.  
Thank you for this amazing website.

May I suggest you upload the files you used in the gifs?

That way we can practice and see if we can reach the same result without looking at the gifs.

Good luck!
now do this with vba please
I only gave it a quick scan now but what will make me come back is the clean, modern appearance.  It's pleasing to look at.
Thanks!
Great idea! Love it! 
Awesome website! 
Pretty cool! 
Bookmarked and looking forward for more great tips! Thanks.
Really amazing! I'm going to share this with my users :)
The gifs are great. Very fast to read over the articles. Great work will be recommending this to any excel beginners. 
Really cool! May I ask how you make gifs in excel?
love it, great job
The gifs are great.  Have a few users that I think would benefit from this as a starting point for using formulas and navigating Excel.  

Examples for pivot tables would be a great addition.  
This is great! Thanks so much!
This looks to be a fantastic resource and the gifs are a great touch.  I'll be showing this to a few of the folks in my office at our next training because I think the visual aid would be extremely useful for the people who are scared of the "new technology". 

Edit: Forgot to say thanks for the great work OP! This community is great because of all the contributors like you who are trying to spread the gospel of excel. 
Honestly, thanks for doing this! I'm bookmarking this :)
I just have to know....
Why luck instead of Luke? 
I love the use of Gifs. So much easier than screen shots. 
This is great! I just introduced one of my classes to excel for a math assignment and the full handle blew their little heads off.
Love the 7 steps to efficiency.   
But I thought I was going to learn how to put gifs into a spreadsheet:).   
I've looked for years on a way to make a cell flash a color on/off.   So that cell catches the lazy eye.
Excellent, thanks very much.
Good job ! bookmarked for work.. feedback due next week )
I liked and bookmarked it! Fairly new to Excel and I enjoyed learning this way.

Nice. I am always looking for something like this to share with my juniors. I have decent skills in excel but teaching someone those skills is challenging and time consuming.
I noticed that you always start in B2, which is a great practice, however you do not mention that (from what I read).

The best tip ever is to always start in B2 or greater.  This leaves white space for readability, and is easier to add columns and rows if needed (in the old Lotus 123 and Excels of the 90s, it was difficult to add rows and columns without a blank row or column)
Bookmarked. I'm a fan. Excellent work, hope to see you expand on it. People always ask me why I don't use the mouse when using excel... #facepalm
When talking about what buttons to press:


Seeing the buttons in the gif as you press them would be very helpful. Now while watching the gif I still need to read some text, like with the very fist examples (tab tab tab). The special symbols for it do help though.
I created this new account just to say thank you for creating this.

For whatever reason, I've never known how to work in excel.

Your tutorial is so straight forward and simple... I'm already on your 3rd tutorial and can now format correctly and create formulas.

My goal after completing your tutorials is to then find a nice Pro Forma excel template and play around in it for my business.

Thanks!!
Looks realy good, if i was a beginner it would for sure be a good place to start learning all the tricks :)
Excellent (no pun intended) work!  I'm going to share this with friends and coworkers interested in learning Excel.  The gifs are a fantastic touch that take this to the next level.

Suggestions: add PowerPivot and PowerQuery tutorials!  I'd love to learn more about the two via your website:)
Another thought - tutorial around the use of $ with ranges would be great
This website you made is awesome.  My only criticism is maybe use real world examples instead of random numbers.  
Just found this today.  Very very useful and easy to digest!
Are you planning on updating this again? It's been a while. :(
Came across this today, found it quite useful,FairPlay 
Glanced at a couple of pages -- very nice and clean design! One page I happened to land on was the error values, and you have some incomplete or incorrect information:

* #NAME? is not solely about function names. It's the error when Excel is unable to understand something in your formula, which may be a misspelled function, or an undefined named range. [See Microsoft's page on correcting #NAME? errors.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-correct-a-NAME-error-B6D54E31-A743-4D7D-9B61-40002A7B4286)
* Describing #NULL! as being a consequence of a syntax is misleading. It tends to appear when you refer to a range intersection with 0 cells, i.e., there is no intersection. The intersection operator is a space, so in your example, "=D2+E2 F2", the "E2 F2" part means "return the range at the intersection of E2 and F2" which does not exist, hence the #NULL!. [See Microsoft's page on correcting #NULL! errors.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Correct-a-NULL-error-11a15515-5df3-4a82-899e-e4c0070ea9c4)

Also, a small typo: at the bottom of the page, the bullet point for #VALUE! has a small typo "diffent", which should be "different."

Again, this looks great and I'm sure will be a wonderful resource. Nice job!
Awesome to hear that! 
Thanks! Let me know if you have any questions or feedback :-)
I would love that, thanks :-)

And that's a good point, I'll talk about AND() and OR()!

Not yet, but I plan to write some articles about VBA in the future!
also teach me python and sql

I use an app called LICEcap.
Seconded. I can really use some help with pivot tables. :P 

Great site overall, OP. Well done! 
Looking forward to it!
Thanks, but I think I already have an Excel tutorial about that: [Six Common Errors and How to Fix Them](https://www.excelfrog.com/error)
Interesting, I never really thought about that. I just start in B2 because it looks better. What are other avantages of doing so?
Awesome, and thanks for the feedback :-)
Good points! I'll do the edits later when I have some time. Thanks :-)
Hey man, fantastic work with the website, love it! Keep up the awesome work!
Thank you! I already showed it to our Trainer. 
BASIC plz
Looks better (white space)

Easier to grab small tables and move them

Easier to add rows and columns (this was very important in the late 80s / 90s)

Able to add headers later without adding rows

Shrinking or expanding Column A and Row 1 width and height can lend to better appearance

Avoids accidentally clearing out A1 when moving to HOME and fat fingering delete

Overall, I think this is a preference thing now, mostly because it looks cleaner, but there was a time where if you started in A1 and wanted to make changes, it was a pain to move things around (Lotus 123 in the 80s).
In your [Six Common Errors and How to Fix Them](https://www.excelfrog.com/error) tutorial, you have a spelling mistake in your ***The #REF! Error*** section. 

I believe this sentence: 

>That can happen when you delete a column, or past stuff on top of data.

Should read: 

>That can happen when you delete a column, or **paste** stuff on top of data.

Thanks again for the fantastic resource you have created.
In the same section "#####" can also be due to a negative date. I know you aren't trying to list every possible error, but in the way you have described it, "####" appears to only refer to a cell not being wide enough. 
What is the website where you plan to recommend [Excelfrog](https://www.excelfrog.com/)?
Oh, I didn't know that, thanks for the info!
Yes, I gave them link to Excelfrog.com 
Yes but my question is: what is the url of the website that is going to mention excelfrog?
Oh, sorry now I got it. 
It's on an Intranet, internal site accessible only for our employees. We have section called "IT how to" - I posted in the there under "Tips and Tricks" section and I will include it in my bi-weekly email.
