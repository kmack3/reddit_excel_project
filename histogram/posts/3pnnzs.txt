Is there any sort of organized league or sporting version of dualing excel spreadsheet users?
yes, near the end of this planet money [podcast](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/02/25/389027988/episode-606-spreadsheets) they mention a modeling competition featuring people from big banks. the prize is a golden keyboard with no F1 key.

edit: i read your note as well. i don't know if it's live, but that sounds awesome. it would be cool if we organized that through Reddit somehow and posted it to youtube
Not sure I'd go to an event for it, but there are YouTube channels with some cool Excel content.

We could do it live over Google docs or just a live stream of desktops? If we had competitions within the sub that would be something

It's not 100% Excel but many of the challenges presented to the participants take place in Excel.
Haha it'd be kinda fun to have a twitch like setup for Excel. Competitions could be held on a semi-regular basis, add-in development, etc. 
I would so watch dueling Excel users on Twitch.
this is gold. literally. keyboard gold. no copy paste either.
FANTASTIC! You destroyed my own spreadsheet productivity. Thta's a magic trick in itself.

Google Docs might not have the same mystique, and it might not have all the same macro / formulaic stuff. UI learning curve... but you are right. The real time "google wave" type updating is perfect. I admit I wouldn't have a clue how to set this up in Excel or Google Docs. I like the idea of trying to build formulas while erasing other people's work. lol

Thank you for this. Can't wait to clicky.
Yep, Sooooooo many cool tricks. Just can't find the time to watch them all.
