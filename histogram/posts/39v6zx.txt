Who are your favorite Excel experts?
Chandoo.
This subreddit? Does that count?
Rob Collie, Scott Senkeresty, Marco Russo, Alberto Ferrari,  Chris Webb, Kasper de Jonge, Gerhard Brueckl and Javier Guillen.  Power BI world.   New school excel. 
[http://www.excel.tv] (Excel TV) - enjoy this youtube series and community. Some of the best of the best in the industry. I enjoy being exposed to the different experts using Excel in different ways.
I liked John Walkenbach while learning.  I still keep the books nearby for reference. 
[Allen Wyatt's](http://www.tips.net/A0001_Allen_Wyatt.html) Excel Tips newsletter is pretty fantastic. Searchable tips database, premium e-books, and free tip e-mailed every Saturday morning.

* Mike Alexander of Bacon's Bit especially for [this](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/fill-the-empty-cells-left-by-pivot-table-row-fields)

* Ron de Bruin for his CDO samples

* Bob Umlas for **Zoom 39%** (who the hell invented this trick?)
Why has no-one said me... ;_;
I am a big fan of [Bill Jelen](https://www.youtube.com/user/bjele123) because I used his forums for a long time.

I didn't discover Mike until his dueling Excel.  I love seeing two solutions for the same problem.
ExcelIsFun is great.  I learned a lot from him also.
 What about [Mr. Excel](http://www.mrexcel.com/)? He was on Leo Laporte's last incarnation of Call for Help the Canadian version.
Thanks for introducing ExcelIsFun. I like his style of teaching, much enthusiasm.
There's something about the way in which he explains things that really resonated with me when I was teaching myself more advanced Excel stuff.
Absolutely!
Haha power BI is covered! Rightfully so.
Power Pivot rules!
They're great. I was lucky enough to meet them last year, really good guys. I like the way that they invite experts from all areas of the excel community. Jordan has visited this subreddit a couple of times.
I think /u/timprovost basically did!

Edit: In any case, thanks for all your generous contributions /u/epicmindwarp!
See Mr. Excel above.  /u/Spovik got him.
Out of curiosity, how many areas does the excel community have? 
Ah, gotcha.

I couldn't remember his name and just control F'ed for "Mr. Excel".
Lots. I'm not aware of any sort of consensus on a way in which the excel community can be broken into well defined areas so don't know how to respond with anything more informative than that, sorry.
Now you got me curious. Can you please name some examples:
Sure - there are university students, business users, engineers, scientists, and statisticians.
