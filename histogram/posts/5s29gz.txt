Hello!

It looks like you tried to award a ClippyPoint, but you need to reply to a particular user's comment to do so, rather than making a new top-level comment.

Please reply directly to any helpful users and Clippy, our bot, will take it from there. If your intention was not to award a ClippyPoint and simply mark the post as solved, then you may do that by clicking Set Flair. Thank you!

It takes about 10000 of those moments to get good...

You have awarded one point to _hitesh102_.
