How to make a master sheet that auto-populates with the other sheets?
I did this years ago with 4-5 sheets all linked and feeding off of each other. Let me see if I can dig it up.
Can I ask why you don't just merge them manually into one sheet and make a column for location? Then Format as Table and use filters to show what you care about? Then Insert Pivot Table if you need summaries?

To clarify, why do you NEED individual worksheets? What benefit does that provide?
my time to give back to this amazing subreddit! I think I solved your issue using vlookup and some other simple formulas.

And [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/100627562/Reddit.xlsx) you can download it.

Let me know if it works for you!
May we have more details pls? Perhaps a screenshot of what you want to achieve?
Okay, so I have an inventory of my wine shop that I have each country on a different sheet. I am wanting to have all of the countries on one master sheet that will auto-populate when I edit the individual sheet or vice versa.[ Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7qTcJFN-Cp4N2lQRmpPS1pRRUU) is a link to the workbook.
What columns do you want to appear in the Master sheet?

If this [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/ljEIRdS.png) shows what you want, then you can get the file from [here](http://www.filedropper.com/youraunt-20160424).
Not OP, but do you think you could post the instructions for someone who can't download that file? 
I would like all of them, so I guess A-L. 
I was hoping to have on long list on the master page that has all of the details like the other pages. Like still have the heading and details on top but have all the countries listed and be able to edit either the master page or the individual country page and have it show up in the other. This is helpful though I do like having a summary like that.
