profit
no..get experience. id take someone with 6 months of real world experience over someone with a certification 


As someone who's sat on the other side of the table, not really.  If Excel is a big part of the role you'll have a self-contained task assigned to complete before the interview, and I'll judge you on how well structured your file is, whether it's clear (ideally self-explanatory), how many errors you make, and if you met the requirements / followed the instructions.

If it's a more minor part of the role, I'd assign a test where you'd need to use lookups on other sheets, move columns around, calculate average profit #s and do some basic projections.  I'd then ask you your opinion on what makes a good spreadsheet vs. a bad one.

When it comes to skills like this, BS doesn't get your far, and neither do qualifications.  Demonstrate that you can do it properly and we'll carry on talking.

Excel certifications really aren't that valuable. Practical, presentable experience trumps it every time, but this certification really isn't that expensive or time consuming if you're already an advanced Excel user so it's up to you.
Learn, practice, create your own examples. Then, answer the interview questions with your new found knowledge in excel. If the interviewer does not ask you questions about your Excel skills, then bring it up in the interview. You MUST show the interviewer that you have the Excel skills needed for the job.
Like others have said, I don't think any certification is all that impressive.  That being said, I would reference specific excel abilities in your cover letter, such as pivot tables, vlookup and index/match, logic functions, and chart creation.  If you know VBA, be sure to mention it.
Here's how the job interviews I've been doing the last couple of months have been going.

Me: So I see you've got a bachelor in sales and marketing, did you learn about Excel at all?

Them: Oh yes, tons! Basically the whole last year was Excel.

Me: Fantastic! Where would you say your skill level is? What is your grasp of Excel?

Them: Oh well, I mean everything really it's not that hard.

Me: Everything? So if I gave you this dataset [list a massive dataset neatly put up so that a pivot table could rock it's world in about 
five seconds] how would you tell me, for example total revenue per product or average revenue per region?

Them: Uuuuh...I mean, I'd have to look it up in my book but...ahm

Me: What do you know how to do in Excel?

Them: Well..I mean, we spent a lot of time looking at gant charts

Me: Do you know how to make a gant chart?

Them: Well..I mean if I had my book I could probably....

So, your competition is not exactly fierce here. About two hours of youtube will put you at the top of my pile.
I'm genuinely curious if any employer really cares about how good you are at Excel.

I'm a Windows system admin, and I mentioned VBA in my interviews, but my boss-to-be really didn't seem that interested at all in it. It was a throw away comment.

Months later I was doing all the heavy lifting for the HR and accounting departments when it came to more complicated spreadsheets, and it was a huge boon for the IT office that really improved the perception of us.

It just seems like everyone thinks "oh yeah, I know Excel."
How do you convince the employer that those skills are incredibly valuable?
Honestly, if someone could do all these things accurately and know when to use them, they'd be in the top 20-30% of users
Skip vlookup and learn index match instead and if the interviewer asks, be prepared to answer why it's a much more powerful set up
Alright guess I oughtta strap myself into the excel experience cannon
A buddy of mine represents his company at job fairs, often held at area universities,  He's gotten into the habit of looking at someone's resume and asking them a simple question about something they have listed as being proficient in.  

> "Oh, you know C#?  What is a class?"
> 
> "Oh, you know databases? What is a table?"
> 
> "Oh, you know networking?  What is the OSI model."

9/10, the person can't answer correctly. 
Would you know of a sample of this type of assessment available online somewhere?
True but every person and their mother claims Excel expertise. Having a certification just confirms that you have a high level of expertise.
I'm looking for a corporate financial analyst gig so I think it's fairly pertinent.

I guess it's highly dependent. Not like you can't Google the answer to 99% of any excel issue anyway.
Yes! I have slowly been convincing my firm to include an excel test as part of the interview process. We work in excel 90% of the time and if you don't know how to sum or add columns/rows I don't want to waste my time teaching you. You aren't worth it.
well, if they know excel you won't have to convince them of anything.

If they don't place any value in excel, you need to focus on addressing the qualifications they deem important and surprise them with your awesome abilities once you have the job
About 90% of the work I do is in excel and in the course of the 2 years I've held my current job I've learned so much on my own just out of necessity of making my own job easier. Looking at the way most people around me work with excel, I'd say just learning to navigate with shortcuts would alone put you in the top half. Now my job feels less like work and more like playing a strategy game.
You're joking right?
Do NOT skip Vlookups. Learn Index Match.
I never had any formal training in Excel. All the experience I have comes from spreadsheets I made myself. I made spreadsheets to track participation in a training guild for a game. I made one to determine the best stats to choose in another game. I made one to track my spending habits. 


When I didn't know how to do something I went on Google and searched for how to do it and tried each of the solutions until I understood how to apply it. Now my work relies on me to create new spreadsheets for them and to fix things they messed up. Experience in Excel is easy to come by if you are looking to get it.
Experience doesn't have to be "I wad a Financial analyst for 4 years working with and creating large spreadsheets with data pulled from Yada Yada"

You can find something that interests you and do analysis on it.  Create a personal budget in excel.  Create your own check registry.  Go to local non profit and volunteer to make them a spreadsheet if they need one.

There's plenty of options to get experience without getting a job.  I got my "experience" in a job that required literally no excel at all.  I found a process that was slow and repetitive and created a macro to semi-automate it and I added formatting and filters to force users to use it the way I wanted.  Then I listened to feed back and continuously updated it.
I just use one that I made a few years ago.  It's not something I'd farm out to an agency or similar, so I've never looked for one / found one I would recommend.
1 year into corporate finance at a F100 company here, let me know if you have any questions on excel use, interviews, career path, etc.

I would echo what some others have said: a certification won't be as important as experience. In the meantime, while you're looking to get excel experience on the job, become familiar with Pivot Tables, Vlookup, and logical formuals (mainly IF statements). That will be plenty fine for an entry level position if it gets brought up in an interview.
YESSS!
Not in slightest. Hell, knowing vlookup alone puts you in the top 50%
Why should they not skip vlookup? Outside of understanding what it does and why index match is better what is there to know?
(Not trying to be a dick, I'm genuinely curious)
Would you care to share yours? I'm always interested to see what my excel skills are by other peoples measuring sticks.
I might know more than I realize. I have only been working in excel for 6 months...
VLookups can be much faster for people who are power-users (only keyboard). If you structure/normalize your data, VLookups (and more, if you know what I mean) are all you need.
I'm not the other guy, but one reason is that you have to know how Vlookup works to understand why Index Match is better. In interview situations, you'd best be prepared to explain the difference!
Not the guy you are talking to, but mine was embarrassingly simple.  They basically gave me a 30 column data set, and asked me to create 3-4 relevant charts out of it.  The only things I was asked to demonstrate skill-wise were COUNTIFS and a Text-to-Column step.

Just remember to show them all the things that you can do (relevant to the problem).  I produced a line chart, pie chart, clustered bar chart, and a pareto chart for my sample presentation.  They didn't even look at the excel file itself, though I had run numbers with formulas (countif, averageif, etc) as well as demonstrating knowledge of pivots.
I can if you like, although I'd need to anonymise it first.  Send me a PM with an email address.  I'll send the full file, which has everything in one and is also used as a training file.
My company hired an entry level analyst a few weeks ago.  Here is what was on the test:
-Make a chart
-Make a PivotTable
-Write a formula using the SUM function
-Write a formula using VLOOKUP
The very fact that youre on this sub is a sign you're a step above. Most people are *completely* content to just get by with whatever they came to the party with, never learning any more, never googling any question they have, never excelling. Would you believe that 9/10 people I work with don't even use functions! And I'd say it's a pretty normal workplace. For them, Excel is just a word processor/visual calculator with a grid for lining things up... I am constantly being called in to fix formatting problems...

Last I heard (and really I have no idea) Microsoft suspected there were half a million people using Office. I guarantee you that 250,000 of those people have never used an IF formula, let alone a VLOOKUP. But within the 250,000 that have, the degree of skill rises very quickly, so it requires more and more knowledge to climb up to the next bracket.
What sort of skills do you think the 1% of the 250,000 people have right now? 
The way I see it, Excel has gotten so big that people have spilt up their studies of it into subgroups/specifications/specialties- things such as:

* Software Development with VBA. This would be things like creating add-ins, UDFs, business solutions, and right on up to full applications.
* Database creation and maintenance, with an understanding of data structures and likely SQL, possibly using the familiar Excel environment as the front or back end of an Access database
* The fast growing world of online uses, such as ETL, web scraping, dataset creation and massaging, likely making heavy use of Power Query & with at least some understanding of VBA.
* BI, dashboarding, and real world modeling, with PowerPivot, charting, and analytics

So the top 1% of all Excel users right now, in my opinion, would have to be a go-to expert in **all** things native to the software, and then also be an expert in **at least** one specialty.

Here's the thing: when you get to the point where you are comfortable enough with Excel and/or the specialties I listed that you feel confident you can do **anything** with the software with nothing but time, a search engine, and your current body of knowledge, you are a veritable expert and should be recognized as such. My guess is that the people who are in the top 1% of all users right now are exactly the same, but don't really need the search engine part, and because of that, not as much time.
Thank you! You sound well versed in Excel, VBA, Access. Can I ask you some questions about your career/experience via PM?
Absolutely. I love talking about these things.
