Surviving Excel on Macs
I just run the windows version in a virtual machine, I've never figured out how to be productive in the Mac version.
[This](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Keyboard-shortcuts-in-Excel-2016-for-Mac-acf5419e-1f87-444d-962f-4e951a658ccd) is helpful for shortcuts, but also changing so that you can use the F keys (which are not enabled by default)




Best tip I can give you is to enable 1min AutoSaves.

Excel gets finicky when you have filters on and try to scroll. And forget about sorting with complex formulas.
If you can, just use the 2016 version of Office. Excel is almost exactly as it is on Windows.
Analysts at Apple run Excel in VMs too
This is the correct answer.
The first change I made was switching the F keys' functions. Thanks! I've been there a few times, the alt-key ribbon shortcuts are greatly missed right now. 
Yep I am using that version and it is pretty close to the windows experience. Or at least a lot closer than before.
Would you recommend something like Parallels to do this ?
I was actually curious about this. I'm an analyst and Mac lover but I can't for the life of me use excel on the Mac. Are you familiar with whether or not they also use a PC keyboard? I always get the keyboard shortcuts mixed up when using my apple keyboard and it's frustrating. 
I'm in a similar situation as you, and am seriously considering dual booting Windows on my MacBook just to have use of the ALT shortcuts. 
I have two Macs, one with Parallels and the other with VirtualBox.  Both work great, I'd probably just go with VirtualBox since it's free.  Parallels has some nice integration and management features, but I don't typically use them and don't think they're worth the extra money to me.
Thanks for that!
