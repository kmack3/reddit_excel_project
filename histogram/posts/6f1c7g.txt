Excel concatenating a " quotation in string
Single quotes are put in by just typing in two quotes (`""`), but then that can mean three or four quotes in total.

    =""""&A1&""" """&B1&""""

that is

  =" "" "  &  A1  &  " "" "" " & B1  &  " "" "

or

    =CONCATENATE("""",A1,""" """,B1,"""")
i found one solution is to use `char(34)` https://exceljet.net/formula/double-quotes-inside-a-formula. Are there other solutions to this?

EDIT: also `""""` works too
When producing a " I prefer using the ASCII symbol by using the function CHAR(34)... It makes the formula more readable and less prone to errors:


=CHAR(34) & "a" & CHAR(34) & " " & CHAR(34) & "b" & CHAR(34)
ah okay I see

`= """ hello """` 

produces 

`"hello"`

**EDIT** the only problem with this method is it doesn't work with variables, only text
Solution Verified
Those are the two main solutions, unless you want to put a quote mark into a cell, then reference that cell in your concatenation
Yup, exactly. And I just edited in the CONCATENATE solution.
