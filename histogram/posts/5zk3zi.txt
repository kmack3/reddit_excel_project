Enron spreadsheets on GitHub
hmmm, in excel pre-excel '07, there was no distinction between xlsx and xlsm files, you just had the xls file, which could contain macros. 

All of these are saved as xlsx files. 

Do you know if something has gone lost in the process? 
Very good point! I got the sheets [here on figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Enron_Spreadsheets_and_Emails/1221767). They're in a tricky zip format, so I thought I'd republish to make them more accessible, since I was doing some testing with them anyway. I believe they were published on figshare by [Felienne](http://www.felienne.com/archives/3634), so I'm guessing she processed them and rewrote them as .xlsx
yeah, kinda interesting though, I just tried making a .xls file, and saved it as .xlsx just by renaming it, but on opening I get an error message saying invalid file extension. 

The other way around works fine (xlsx->xls). So each file seems to have been processed somehow by opening up and saving in a new format, essentially disabling any potential code.  Seems a bit odd, but I am not too keen to download a 9gb file to look into it lol! 

Btw felienne is the one who made that talk on excel as pure functional programming that was posted last year! Pretty entertaining :P

Totally agree with Felienne on "spreadsheets are code". IMHO a sheet that's just tabulated data isn't code - it's just data. But add just a single formula, and then it's code. Code developed in a functional grid based visual programming environment.
That was a super interesting talk. I'm a programmer by training and used excel alot for my internship, it never occurred to me that excel was essentially fuctional programming (when you aren't using vba).
Geekiest conversation I've ever seen
