Excel 2007 to Excel 2016 - Any advices, remarks, tips, etc to note?
My work made a [free webinar about Excel 2016](http://www.icaew.com/en/technical/information-technology/excel/webinars-excel/excel-2016-a-proper-version-of-excel).
Try adding an S to your favourite functions. Sumif, countif and if all have new versions that accept multiple conditions and replace all those complicated sumproduct formulas
Know the arrows to go to the first and last worksheet they are gone. Incredibly frustrating until I looked up you need to hold ctrl and click the arrows. 
Biggest changes in the code base are probably the Power tools like Power Pivot and Power Query. Tools that you don't think you need at first, but if you ever manage multiple tables and relationships, or if you import or need to automate shuffling of data, those tools are great. Pivot tables also got some upgrades, including Data Model, allowing you to link lots of tables from different sources, and create Pivot Charts without a Pivot Table.

Plenty of UI changes - little things like sparklines, quick summary tools, slicers, icons for conditional formatting. The biggest changes are with graphing - completely redone. It's harder to find what you want to do, so [get to know this dropdown](http://i.imgur.com/7AwnU9B.png) or use arrow keys to select parts of a chart to format (or use the big plus sign).

Overall, a cleaner UI, more advanced tools, but 90% of your experience will be the same. Not many new formulas, outside of the statistical ones getting more specific (with those dots, like FORECAST.LINEAR).


haven't checked out 2016, but 2010 has [maps](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-Power-Map-88A28DF6-8258-40AA-B5CC-577873FB0F4A) and [slicers](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-slicers-to-filter-PivotTable-data-249F966B-A9D5-4B0F-B31A-12651785D29D). pretty sweet...
On the ribbon go to View and select New Window. Enjoy :)
That's nice! Thanks for the tip!
Ctrl-PgUp or down goes to different tabs
I see thanks for the tip! I think it's wonderful they let us open a list of the worksheets (right click I think) to select a sheet in a worksheet with soo many sheets haha
Sumifs is amazing.  I use it at work nearly every day.
