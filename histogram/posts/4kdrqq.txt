I made a video showing how to create a Star Trek Medical lab graph
I had dinner at a friend's house where they showed off their "alexia" device, where you simply say Alexia then ask a question, which the device then answers. So, "Alexia, what time is it." 

As a diehard trekkie, what gives? There should be an option to be able to say, "Computer... what is the time." Because that is the future. 

Needless to say, I appreciate your tutorial :) 
I don't know if I have a use for it but I sure loved the ride :D
I keep trying to train Google Now to accept "computer" in my best Picard voice.
