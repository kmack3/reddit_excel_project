Is it possible to enable Macros to be used in every excel file?
Add the macro to a Personal.xlsb worskbook. This workbook will automatically open every time you open excel - just make sure to hide it or else it gets annoying. 

Hard format on mobile so here's a link:

Enable them in the trust center.

This is what I do. Thoughts?
A few things...
I use my own add-ins to do what you're asking. I name them in a way so that I know what they are, e.g., sub zz_readable_name. I then add the macros to a custom ribbon. I actually save the add-in on the network share, and share them with co-workers.

That said, you don't need to use an addin, as you can use personal.xlsb as well. MS's site has some good instructions for beginners, and intermediate users: [assigning a macro to a button](https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Assign-a-macro-to-a-button-728C83EC-61D0-40BD-B6BA-927F84EB5D2C)

If you want to go with the add-in route:

* Save the file with the macros as an Excel add-in file ( .xlam). The file type is towards the bottom of the list of file types in the save\save-as window. You can now close the file.
* Go to File - Options - Add-ins
* At the bottom of the Add-ins window, you'll see the label Manage, and the drop-down  box should default to Excel add-ins (if not switch to it). Press the GO button.
* Press the browse button, and navigate to the Excel add-in file you just saved.

Or go here to read about it on MS's site - minor variations by version of Excel. You will need to save your macro file as an Excel add-in file first.

Some quick and slightly dirty macros I have in my add-in that I have in a custom ribbon...

* Convert formulas to values (using range.value = range.value, not copy paste)
* Convert formulas to append =iferror(,0) and =iferror(,"")
* Change formula view from A1 to R1C1
* Save without calculating
* Change settings back to normal; screenupdating = true, displayalerts = true, statusbar = false, etc.
* several buttons to quickly change pivot table value formats
* some extremely task specific macros that changes views (hides columns, does not actually use saved views), applies filters, etc.
I would recommend making your macro work book into an Excel Add-In as opposed to trusting every macro. 
Thank you.

I have enabled all macros and check 'tursted access to the VBA project object model' and I still can not access the macros

Ah right, I think I misunderstood.

Add the macro to your personal workbook and then it'll be available in any Excel file you ever open.
