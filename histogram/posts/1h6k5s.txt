Get Cell Fill Colors Without VBA
Can't really say "without vba" when you are using Custom Functions... 
Okay, I came across this trick while reading [Excel Gurus Gone Wild.](http://www.amazon.com/Excel-Gurus-Gone-Wild-IMPOSSIBLE/dp/1932802401/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1372344300&sr=8-1&keywords=excel+gurus) Great book written by Mr Excel,with some neat solutions to some challenging Excel issues.  Anyway, a question I routinely see asked (and apparently is routinely asked in the Mr. Excel Forums) is how do I get the interior color or can I conditionally format based on color. This trick uses an arcane function, that can't be used in a regular cell based formula, but can be used in the Named Formula (or Name Manager) box.  /u/takin_it_sleazy threw up some great code the other day for pulling it in via a custom UDF in VBA, [found here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/1h4hte/finding_excel_color_codes/caqreed) Anyway, I know many people try to avoid VBA for a variety of reasons, and so I thought this was a cool approach.  Don't know how well it works, it may be buggy, but I did get it to work when I tried, as shown in the GIF.  The named formula = GET.CELL(63,INDIRECT("RC",0)) The 63 references the interior cell fill color.  The Indirect("RC",0) basically tells Excel to look in the same cell the formula is in, which works well for conditional formatting.  For some reason, I think this may mute the color codes to either one of the older version of Excel's limitations, so 65 or 256, if memory serves. I just added the 4 cells with the GetFillColor formula to see what the codes the function picked up were. Note that the GET.CELL function returns a whole ton of info about the cell, hard to find on the web, but I did [find it here.](http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/excel-questions/20611-info-only-get-cell-arguments.html) Obviously, it would be great to be able to use these without creating the named formulas, but it doesn't seem to be possible. Anyway, I thought it was cool enough that you might be interested to see it, give it a try. Good luck.  
 
No custom function, just a named formula. I wasn't in VBA at all while doing this. Just the Name Manager. 
Ah sorry guess I misunderstood, thought you were using /u/takin_it_sleazy functions... would be nice if Microsoft just added a way, I mean I am happy now you can count by color, and as much as they know people use colored cells you think they would have added that... maybe in 2016...
No, but frankly I think those functions may work better.  Probably much more flexible, I'm not sure why they haven't added that functionality, either.  This is a bit of a gimmick, I'm not sure it would work well in practice. Going in and creating a name every time you want to retrieve a parameter isn't really very practical, but I thought it was interesting.
