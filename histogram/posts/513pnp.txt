Trying to work out a complicated idea, can excel even do this?
What you are asking can definitely be done but it would be really helpful to the non-musical people if you could define the problem in simpler terms. I don't know what changing the scale means for example.

Set up a smaller, simple sample sheet with similar data that demonstrates what you want to do. What it looks like before, what you want to change and what it looks like after.

I haven't tried any of these but this is what I'd experiment with to make it work...

Seems to me you should be me able to have a few cells with drop downs that have scale types. One for the root, another for maj, min, etc and others for different things (been ages since I did music theory, but you'll get it. 

I might be tempted to work in columns rather than rows too. Assign each fret and string a number so they are all unique then use a lookup table to flip from number to note name. This lets you translate the scale formations into math.

Looks like a fun challenge - I suspect this is more of a design challenge you're taking on but if you're looking for a good app to do this for you, Guitar Toolkit is well worth the cost.

I don't know much about music and scales, but so you don't reinvent the wheel is this useful: http://reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2ph5ww/i_made_a_spreadsheet_modeling_the_guitar_scales/

Edit: googling "excel guitar scales" returns a lot of spreadsheets of varying quality with what you're trying to do.
Sure! Try using Index & Match. This allows you to take a table of values and select the desired column & row. Use the selected key to change the desired column.
I made a web app that has this feature as part of its free tier. It's called whatkeyamiin.com, check out the tool called the fretBoard. I hope you find it helpful!
I have edited my post but I don't think it reads much better, I will do as you say and make a mock up of how I see it.

I like that idea, then I'd be able to do it without having loads of lookup tables in the background, I'll look in to that thanks for your insight!

It is surprisingly fun, although my lack of patience makes it infuriating.

Looks like a cool app, unfortunately I'm stuck with a windows phone at the moment so I can't check it out -__-
I had come across that one in particular when searching around but it seemed way over complicated for my needs. Now I've spent a few hours messing around with this stuff it doesn't look so intimidating, might be able to reverse engineer some of it for my own purposes I hadn't considered that. Thanks very much!

***edit***  Now I've had a proper look at it I can see it's doing everything that I've asked about here, and I don't even need to understand why! Calling this one solved much obliged vbevan!
I always find I learn more, quickly, through reverse engineering someone else's solution. If I start from scratch, it takes me twice as long and I will miss ways other people have thought of to do things. It's why I love sites like github!
