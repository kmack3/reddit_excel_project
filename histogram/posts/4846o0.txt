Excel on a 4K monitor
[Google Sheets example](http://i.imgur.com/YRx88S6.jpg). 
Don't have a 4K monitor, but is there a reason it wouldn't be a linear extrapolation from those two points?
I have a 3440 x 1440 monitor (LG UM95).  I can see column AZ and row 80 at 100% zoom level.  Perfectly legible.
[AM60](http://i.imgur.com/IuDVWkT.png) is the bottom right cell. 

Resolution: 3840x2160

I hope you have a magnifying glass.

I tried running 4k on a 30" with no scaling and it was unusable.
I'm on a 40" 4k without any scaling. 95 rows, and to column BG. Its on my desk, I sit 24-30" away. Make sure you get one that is 4:4:4 Chroma. Good review here, This is the model I bought. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CL8V08eomD4
damn, I got a chubby just looking at all those columns
And its an EvE mining spreadsheet.  Excellent.
There's a profit margin on frigate hulls?
Thank you sir - this helps! I guess it is affected by the width of the columns, but is helpful!

Any eye strain? I am thinking of getting a 4k screen, but am very worried about it being too small - and I hate Win10 scaling.

This must be faked. I don't see your porn folder... =)
I would seriously suggest re-uploading that image with your e-mail address covered. 
Yes. If your have ten lines, and your borders take up two lines, doubling to 20 lines gives you 18 lines. Some things (borders and whatnot) don't increase in size as pixel count increases.
You running at 200% Windows scaling?
In high-security space, no. In NPC null-security space, yes. Volumes are pretty low, though.
I have to have the 4K display quite close (2ft) for me to see the text clearly (it is a 28 inch X 14.5 inch display) . However, such a large resolution makes it easy to manipulate dozens of columns at a time. I wouldn't go back to a 1080p display anytime soon.

If you do get a 4K display, make sure you read up on the different versions of 4K there are and what cables / graphics cards that you need to support them. "Cinema 4K" is the commercial term for what I have. [See Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution).

see that slider in the right of your screen?

^^^^Use ^^^^that. ^^^^100 ^^^^less ^^^^eye ^^^^strain.

Really though if you get a monster that big you can afford (no the money senses) to sacrifice a few to zoom in.

Yeap, I have it set to scale at 250%, 100% is too damn small and I only sit about 2 feet away from my screen
I find it ridiculous that non-cinema 4K wasn't adopted as 2160p, damn marketing...
The question is not about Excel itself...the concern relates to other programs as well...
damn..that Is what i am worried about..

Whats your screen size?
(Sorry I know this is an excel chat, but just curious)

~~I'm googling around and can't seem to find out how to scale the Excel UI, I'd love it if you could point me in the right direction.~~

Never mind, I'm an idiot, you can just zoom out.
39'' the scaling definitely helps, but if you feel uncomfortable with the resolution you can always lower it to 1080p 
Not OP, but 40" - 50" 4K displays have about the same pixel density as a regular 24" 1080p monitor. There was a Philips 40" VA monitor recently released, but other than that you would need a TV to be able to use 4K without scaling. In the meantime I've been happy with older 30" 2560x1600 monitors off ebay for ~$300 shipped.

Here's a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/1m6r4gD.png) without any scaling at 2560x1600.
Yep. Currently use a 50" 4k as my treadmill monitor - 3ft away and I can still manage 100% scaling, which makes for a nice setup of 4x24" monitors. It's beautiful.
Can you explain this setup?
[Sure thing. See this screenshot](https://imgur.com/g3hfHGj). In W10 you're allowed to 'snap' windows to whatever size/proportion you desire, so if I'm working on a bigger sheet either row or column wise, I can expand it as necessary. Many times I leave things at 2k, it just depends on what I'm working on. Here I've got two of the quadrants combined into one on the left hand side because I need the rows (on the other non-blank sheets).
