Fix dates without a formula
This is really nice.  As an old timer, I wonder how many other fixes exist now that I don't think to look for and just do it the same old way.
[Also works in the same column](http://i.imgur.com/OrgOZQ1.gif), if you just want to overwrite it.

I rarely run into this particular issue, but a good reminder of the power of text to columns. I definitely went HOLY SHIT when I watched the video :)
Fuck, I was just trying to figure this out on Friday.
I found that on accident one time, when I was trying to remove the time stamp at the end of a date string.  I just selected, and hit text to columns then finish  - had no idea why it worked though.  Thanks for showing more detail.
I'm having a much different problem. But need a similar result. The value in A1 is 41885 A Bar & Kitchen. In B1 i have a formula: =left(A1,5) to extract the numbers i want in date format. Now B1 has a formula, but needs to be in date format. No matter what I do with the formatting of B1, I cannot get the number 41885 to change to 9/1/2014. Please help!

Text to columns is a god send. Got huge column of numbers stored (say SSNs?) that a client send over stored as text? Text to columns. Fixed.

Want to separate full names into their components? Text to columns. Done! (Maybe do some quick error checking.)

Have several columns of data you need to copy from a pdf but it is copying all into a single excel column...
Left is a text formula, so you need to convert it to a number.  Try this:

    =LEFT(A1,5)+0    

Good luck.
But in this case the actual original values were not true dates. If you wanted to use them in any formula it wouldn't work properly. 
You should just put that in your user flair. ;)

You could also multiply by 1, I tend to do that especially when I'm going VLOOKUPs

Thanks!!

MY BAD. Didn't look close enough at your source data. Took you for a newb :) My apologies for the snark!
That is a great idea.
Or =value(ref)...but text to columns does the entire column in 2 clicks. By far the most efficient way.
