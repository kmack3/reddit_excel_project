How do I create a conditional formatting formula where if A1 has data and B1 is blank, B1 turns red
Select B1, then go to Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Use a formula to decide which cells to format. Then type AND($A$1<>"",$B$1="") into the formula box and select your red formatting option. That should work.
What does <> represent in Excel?

Does not equal.
