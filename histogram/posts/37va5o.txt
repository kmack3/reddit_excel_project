This sub (This isn't a question, nor is it useful, but it has to be said.)
Oh, you are SO right.  I swear finding this sub was like finding an illicit stash of something extremely salacious.  
>  the information is beautifully organized, and it is clear that the mods run a tight ship.

Why thank you very much! The team is happy to read this!! 

We do put a lot of effort in, and it's great to hear that it actually makes a difference - so thank you!

Simply keep your eye on the stickys. I notice you don't have any ClippyPoints. Is it because you're unaware or you haven't solved any problems yet? Do let me know if it's unclear and we'll keep working on it!

Thanks!
I've learned that Excel knowledge is not found in helping yourself but in helping others. Having to explain solving problems to people will exponentially make you better in the long run.
Thanks for the kind words, the entire mod team has put in work to try and keep this sub active and running with new things and not just make this your standard excel help site.  

We are always looking at new ways to improve Clippy, the subreddit, and we always try to include our community in as many of those things as we can!

But mostly we only have the 25k subscribers to thank for the success of the sub, without you guys, contributes, lurkers, question askers, we would not have much.  It always amazes me when someone comes here to ask a question and before we know it they have ClippyPoints^TM and become another reliable contributor... 

> I haven't solved any problems yet. I'm a little gun-shy still!

Don't be... just reading through the posts you will see many different ways to do things, and most of the time if your solution does not work, someone will come along and figure out why.  It is a great way to learn, and challenge yourself to become better at Excel.
I try to help out where I can, but most of the time another great user has already answered the OP. I still read the posts, even when I think I know the right answer, just to check my understanding, or learn a new or better way to do it. 

I use Excel a lot less these days at work, but still find it to be a fun challenge to find the right combination of formulas to get what I need. 
Agreed. The management of flair here really makes the sub run smoothly. I've just started using the sub for the last couple of weeks, and I've fallen in love.
As a non-IT person, I have been floored by the stuff I come across in this sub. Before, I would have considered myself fairly proficient in Excel, but I had no idea how much I didn't know (and how much it is capable of). This sub alone has ignited my desire to delve deeper, and a few very minor things that I've learned have alreadybmade an impression on my boss, which is never a bad thing. => So I would also like to voice my thanks, to the mods and the contributors. It's a brave new world for me!

I like your vocab. And your comment as a whole. We appreciate it!
underwear pics?  in Excel?  lol!
.
I'm on mobile right now. What does a clippy point do? I'm assuming they are earned by providing helpful answers?
I haven't solved any problems yet. I'm a little gun-shy still! 
I've told my coworkers that my theory of life is that there is no situation that can not be improved by the application of an elegantly designed spreadsheet.
For spreadsheet-groupies, it might as well be a hidden underwear stash!
None that are as *consistently* and accurately informative. 
Yes! You can read all about it on the sidebar link to the wiki. 

Its very simple and helps recognise contributors. 
you see babe, this is why I'm leaving you - especially note columns C, F, & H.

I can pivot table this if it makes mo ... hey! where are you going!? I was just getting started!
See? Isn't that a vast improvement on, "it's not you, it's me?"
