List Top 5 Values including duplicates
[This should work](http://i.imgur.com/zeXnpVp.png). The RANK function accounts for ties, so would consider Tristen to be rank 3 in your example.

    =INDEX(Name,RANK(ROW(A1),Score))

Note `ROW(A1)` is just 1, and increments as you drag down. In my example I could have used `D2` and dragged down as well.
Select all your data, then on menu bar, choose Data->Sort, check my data has headers, then sort by Col B, Largest to Smallest.
Sheet 1 has your data in columns a and b. Sheet 2 has your top 5. 

Sheet1:
Column A has names
Column B has Score
Column C is a helper column that give unique scores by adding a "."&1,2,3... 

use this formula

=B2&"."&countif(B$2:B2,B2)

=B3&"."&countif(B$2:B3,B3)
... you can drag down this column



Sheet 2:

A1-A5 list values 1,2,3,4,5.

B1-B5 array formula =large(sheet1!B1:B5,A1) ***this is an array formula so you have to press crtl+shift+enter to make it work, if done correctly the { } should appear around the formula.

C1-C5 is a helper column that makes a unique value for the score
=B2&"."&countif(B$2:B2,B2)

D1-D5 index match your unique value to name
=index(Sheet1!A:A,match(C1,Sheet1!C:C)

Hide you helper Columns to make it less confusing to people looking at your top 5 list.

Alternately, you can use a pivot table but I always find it a pain if I have to keep formatting the information.





Here is my take on your problem.

If top5 isn't a strict requirement, then you can also putthe data in a Pivot and apply the top10 value filter.
pivot the table and filter on top 5

It needs to be an array for your purpose. You need to incorporate the LARGE function with your index match. Search YT for ExcelIsFun array magic large  index match.
