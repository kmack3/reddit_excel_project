Is it possible to create a combo "If statement" that looks at more than one cell? For example: IF(C3=Yes AND C4>12% then....)
just need to change the format a little

    =if(and(c3="Yes",c4>12%),1,0)

Where 1 is the number if both conditions are correct and 0 if none or only 1 condition is correct. 
    =IF(AND(C3="Yes",C4>0.12),True,False)
I had this exact problem yesterday, =countifs was the solution i ended up using
i believe a "loop" through VBA would also work here

Ah okay I'm going to try this right now. You guys are fast!
When I enter that formula the computer wants to correct it by putting an * in front of TRUE. Do you know why?
This should be higher.  From Op's description, sounds like a countif is the better solution.
The last thing this guy wants to do is code in VBA

You're meant to replace True and False with your own statements.

Use this

    =IF(AND(C3="Yes",C4>0.12),"True","False")
Don't forget the "s", allows multiple criteria
Okay I'm still getting an error message..here's my statement:
=IF(and($B5=4130,D5=11) C5,0)

EDIT: oh nevermind I was just missing that comma. This was super helpful. Thanks!!
Well can you expand about = countifs ? ....or should I just look it up in Excel help?
It sounds promising.
Awesome, please reply with Solution Verified to award a ClippyPoint. 
Sure, break this down:
    =if(and(c3="Yes",c4>12%),1,0)

C3 must equal "Yes"

C4 must be over 12%

Result is that the value of the cell with the formula is 1

Then we use count on the column that has the formula

Let's say this is our data:

.|A|B|C|D|E|F
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--
1|John|Mike|Kelly|Janet|Bob|Jared
2|Yes|Yes|No|No|Yes|Yes
3|45%|2%|27%|100%|6%|18%

The countifs function takes in the following input:

criteria_range1 (column to compare to), criteria1 (value to look for), [criteria_range2], [criteria2], .....)

According to the formula above, our criteria is that for each column within our dataset, row 2 has to have the value "Yes" and row 3 has to have a value bigger than 12%.  Let's try to put that into a countifs:

    =COUNTIFS(A2:F2, "Yes", A3:F3, ">="&0.12)

Result:

    2

Bonus tip: If you're comparing across the entire row, you can just use 2:2 and 3:3 as your criteria range

Awesome! I can think of a million ways to start using this.
