Excel iOS and Data Validation Lists
Try zooming out in the hope that the width of the drop-down list would remain constant in pixels so would show more characters. If that doesn't work, try increasing column widths. If neither work, you're likely out of luck.
Looks like I'm out of luck. I tried your suggestions, and I also tried changing the font of the entire worksheet to a smaller font. The data validation drop down remains the same size and font. Alas. Finger stabbing my way through the data would have been easier than using a mouse.
