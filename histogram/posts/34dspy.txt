What are your favourite pranks to play on other Excel users?
Every ~1000th time anyone at 14 locations worldwide runs a macro in a workbook they all use, instead of printing their documentation it prints the "hang in there" photo with the kitten hanging from the tree branch.  I don't think it's happened twice anywhere, so I can only assume everyone probably thinks they accidentally did it themselves.
I've just added a button that says "DO NOT PRESS" underneath a button that they regularly press. When the user presses it, it will randomly open a number of excel and word docs and add one character to the docs so the user has to manually say no to saving each doc when they close them.
This is best played on someone who doesn't really know much about vba.

Create a module and name it something generic which looks half important such as "IndexDB_Main" or something and input the following code:
   
    Sub RandomTime()
        Dim z As String
        z = "00:" & Round(Rnd(Now * Rnd(Rnd(Now))) * 15, 0) & ":" & Round(Rnd(Now + Round(Now, 5)) * 60, 0)
        Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue(z), "SpeakNow"
    End Sub


    Sub SpeakNow()
        TalkSpeak = GetSpeach()
        Application.Speech.Speak TalkSpeak
        Call RandomTime
    End Sub
    

    Function GetSpeach()
    x = Round(Rnd(Now * Rnd(Rnd(Now))) * 2, 0) + 1
    MsgBox x
    y = ""
    Select Case x
        Case 1
            y = "i'm sorry dave i'm afraid i can't let you do that"
        Case 2
            y = "I'm watching you"
        Case 3
            y = "swoswoswoswoswoswo"
        End Select
    GetSpeach = y
    End Function



Now on your chosen worksheet or on workbook open call RandomTime. Sit back and laugh as they freak out.
You can add many more lines to the case block(and change the multiplication in the x value to add new outputs.

Bonus points for using If Environ("Username") = "Victims Username".
Modify someone's personal workbook to have formula calculation set to manual, save it. Now every workbook they open will default to Manual.

I wrote a macro that generated a random number between 1 and 100. If the number was less than 60 it would open my coworkers CD tray. He asked me to figure out what was wrong and fix it so I reduced the probability >:)

if you can run macros on users computers without the warning message, add this to their ThisWorkbook object:

    Private work As Boolean
    
    Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)
        
        If work = False And Target.Cells.Count = 1 Then
            If IsNumeric(Target.Value) And Rnd > 0.95 Then
                work = True
                Target.Value = Target.Value + 1
            End If
        End If
        work = False
    End Sub


If a cell is changed and its value is is numeric, it will sometimes add one to the number. It only happens when 1 cell is changes, so editing multiple cells at once will not trigger the function, which makes detecting this less likely

it can be made less likely by moving 0.95 closer towards 1. 0.999 is almost never
this is the geekiest post i've ever seen on reddit. i love it.

If you want to be a real dick, you can set a counter in VBA (counting mouse clicks or time or whatever) that executes this command upon reaching your limit.  
Sounds like a great way to get fired!
Application.Username combined with Application.Speech
Do you really need all the stuff in the Rnd brackets?  I thought with VBA, calling Rnd() or Rnd(PositiveNumber) both just gave the next number in the sequence.  So Rnd(Now*Rnd(Rnd(Now))) is the same as doing Rnd()?

Also the number returned will be in the range 0-1, so Rnd()*2 will be in the range 0-2.  Rounding this will indeed give either 0, 1 or 2 (and therefore 1, 2 or 3 for your case statement).  However it will give a 0 if the number is 0-0.5, a 1 if it's 0.5-1.5, and a 2 if it's 1.5-2.  Therefore the case 2 statement will appear 50% of the time, and the case 1 and case 3 statements only 25% of the time each.

You should use Int or RoundDown instead, which turn the range of 0-2 into either 0 or 1 (since the range is actually 0.0000 to 1.9999) with the same chance of each.  To get three options, do Int(Rnd()*3).  (You don't need the +1, just change your case statements to 0, 1 or 2)

Of course, if you want the probabilities to be 25% / 50% / 25% then the code works fine (although I would recommend coding it so that those percentages are clear)
You're a monster.  Unless I'm working on a big ugly file, then thanks.
I pulled the opposite of this on my entire reporting team. Crashed 2 computer's due to excessively large workbooks auto calculating!
I'd love to do this. Do you know how to do it on Windows 8.1?
Best thread eu
There are enough idiot users that do that prank to themselves.  No need to do it for them.
Sort by all posts from all time by Top and you'll see an even geekier one.
The spreadsheet is only used by one other person and we prank each other all the time. Plus I'm leaving the company in 2 weeks.
Your workplace sounds like a fun place.
Unfortunatly in my work usernames are a mixture of first and second and names. David Smith would be DSmith02 etc hmm maybe a caseblock for usernames.... * *evil laughter* *
The part initially at the top was supposed to look complex so the victim wouldn't bother reading further down(I think when I actually used this it was embeded among loads of other actual working code. Not that I actually used it with in legitimate working code in my office to annoy people...nope not at all.

You're correct with the rounding tbh I just quickly threw this down it wasn't ment to be perfect code with every but thought out but that's a good obeservation which I never thought about. I'll have to keep that in mind in future.
It'd be more credible if you used another account to rep your own thread :p
That is how I discovered it.
Lol alrighty then. No harm.
Randomly stopping the user from getting actual work done or worse, screwing up a random Word document? Yeah however fun that may seem, I doubt the user or CEO thinks so.
Me too.  Trying to hit Ctrl-1 (shortcut to format cells).
> screwing up a random Word document

He didn't say anything about screwing up existing documents.

I doubt the CEO is tearing his hair out about this.
Did you really come to a thread on pranks to be serious?
