Excel competition
I got invited to compete, but didn't really think about it.  Good luck!
Hello from a former Alabama resident!  If you're ever in NC let me know and I'll buy you a beer.
Woo go /u/Red_M_M !

I'm competing too. We're already connected on LinkedIn and I'll introduce myself in person.

For anyone else interested and in NY, you can attend some of the activities for free by registering:

* Networking event on Friday night: http://www.modeloff.com/innovation/
* Finals on Sunday afternoon: http://www.modeloff.com/livefinals/
I'm up in Canada so unfortunately cannot get together but best of luck !
