How can I simplify this formula?
    =SUM('BAR 1:BAR 20'!H9)

Note I think you have to have the sheets Bar1 to Bar 20 in order (or at least to have bar 1 and bar 20 bookending the others, with no other sheets inbetween).

Yeah good point: it's not iterating over the numbers in the sheet names, it's iterating over the sheets themselves
