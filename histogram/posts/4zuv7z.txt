Hello!

It looks like you tried to award a ClippyPoint, but you need to reply to a particular user's comment to do so, rather than making a new top-level comment.

Please reply directly to any helpful users and Clippy, our bot, will take it from there. If your intention was not to award a ClippyPoint and simply mark the post as solved, then you may do that by clicking Set Flair. Thank you!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/excel) if you have any questions or concerns.*
