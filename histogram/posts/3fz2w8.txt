Self-paced course on Excel VBA now ready
I took this class a few months back and it's really well taught. I highly recommend it for anyone trying to up their Excel skills.
I went through that course and I was very impressed.  Certainly not for anyone who already knows VBA, as the stuff covered is pretty basic, but it is awesome for anyone who is trying to get a start in it.  I've been able to take what they taught me and use it at work and it has been AWESOME!  Totally worth your time if you are new to VBA.
Been waiting for this thanks for the update!
Great course! I took it earlier. Clear and concise videos. I learned a lot. If you want to learn Vba this a great starting point.
Excellent, Thank you!
Can't wait, I'm still in the process of fully learning excel so I hope to compliment that 
I was just discussing VBA with a coworker. Thank you for this!
Oh this is exciting! I can't thank you enough for providing this free content. 
Thanks!

Thank you! You should consider posting this to /r/universityofreddit as well.
I also took this course and highly recommend it. I learned enough of the VBA "building blocks" to start writing my own very useful macros. My boss has been very impressed :)
You sir, are a gentleman and a scholar.
Has the solution for Topic 10, problem 2 been uploaded yet?

I'm checking this out and its worth looking at.
Hi Dr. Nissenson, 

I'm a C# programmer and have been using the .NET framework since it came out in 2002.  Before that I used to do some VBA.  Do you know of any resources for coding in Excel with C# or the .NET framework (or VB.Net)?  I had a side project a few years ago where I was attempting to write a C# program for Excel and found it was very difficult without using 3rd-party tools to create the project.

Just curious if you've come across anything in that area.  Thanks for any ideas!
Hi Paul! just wanted to say thank you. I took your course the last round it was posted on Reddit and taught me everything I needed to produce my own projects. Made me seem like a wizard in the office and just landed me my next position in a new company! 

Just wanted to drop by and say thanks for your course - it was well paced, easy to understand and very useful. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone starting off.

I took this class before and didn't have a chance to finish I've been anxiously waiting to finish it up! Thanks for the update! A lot of my coworkers signed up and finished and our new hires are now going to go through the course.
How easy is it for an immediate user? Know all functions of excel, formulas, pivots, index match, etc.
The course was designed for novice or novice-intermediate people who want to develop a strong foundation in VBA programming. If you know a lot of VBA already, you probably won't learn a lot of new stuff. Toward the end of the course (in Topic 10 I think) I recommend a couple books for people who want to become advanced VBA programmers. 
Have fun learning VBA and let me know if there are any hiccups with the website.
Tell everyone! :)
The platform has had some issues with IE in the past (I don't know if they have been fixed then). Firefox and Chrome are recommended as they have not had the same issues.
Good idea. I didn't know this subreddit existed.
Hear that everyone? Take the course and impress the boss. 
Yes.
I still need to work on that.
Hi there. I have never needed to do something like that and have never researched the topic. Sorry, I can't help you.

Hi mLui. I'm glad you enjoyed the course and that it helped your career. In case you weren't aware, the website has been converted into a self-paced course, so now anyone can take the course at their own pace. Feel free to spread the word! 
Ok ok... I will fix the grammar.
The self-paced version is identical to the 10-week version, so you can pick up where you left off.
It's fairly easy. In the first week, the instructor covers some Excel functions.
It was perfect for me.  I knew nothing about VBA when I started the course, and by the time it was done I was writing macros for use at work.  My skills are still very very basic, but that is mostly because I haven't had the time to pursue it because of other schoolwork.  

I very much appreciated the course.  Thank you for your time!
People at my company could sure learn it. How long would you say the course takes? I have been wanting to get started on vba for a while.
:)


The good thing about programming (at least in my experience) is that you can pick it up again when you need it. So if you have a project in the future that would benefit from VBA programming, it will still be there for you and you can build upon you knowledge.
Depends on the student. Try doing one topic per week.
Thanks for the reply. I will try that.
