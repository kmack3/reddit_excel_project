I just saw this guide to how to make tables on Reddit, and instantly thought of the usefulness it would have in this sub.
Thanks for the reminder. I gave up trying to remember the syntax after this post http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/uos5i/i_made_a_nifty_little_macro_that_will_convert_a/.compact
Yup, that post was glorious.   I now have an XLSX on my desktop with the macro keyed to Ctrl-J

As a result |  |  |

 | putting things |  |

dirt simple! |  |  | 

I should note that there was a slight error I had in the code that wasn't copying the entire selection, I just fixed it and updated the links.  Before it wasn't copying the last row of the selection, not sure how I didn't see that the first time around.
