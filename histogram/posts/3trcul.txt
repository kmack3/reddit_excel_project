What now?
1. Challenge yourself by building a project. Working on something you have not worked on before will force you to learn new subjects and new Excel techniques. Some things I have worked on include analyzing weather data, making a household financial model, and making a 2- and 3-d gravitational model.  

2. Read blogs. This is a great way to pick up ideas for things to work on, learn new tricks, and learn best practices. Here are a few I grabbed randomly from my reader:

[Chandoo](http://chandoo.org/)

[Contextures](http://blog.contextures.com/)

[Daily Dose of Excel](http://dailydoseofexcel.com/)

[Data Pig](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/)

3. *Really* challenge yourself by tackling the intense problems at [modeloff](http://www.modeloff.com/questions/)

4. Read the Qs in this sub and answer some. Nothing gets you thinking like trying to understand what other people are trying to figure out!

Most of all, have fun with it!
* Lynda.com courses, libraries often provide free access to patrons

* ExcelIsFun YouTube channel
Hang out here and try to solve other folks' challenges. 
Something that may help us out with giving specific advice would be for you to describe the career you're looking to enter.
This is great advise, thanks for all the time you out into it
