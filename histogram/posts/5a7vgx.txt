Learning Excel SQL - Resource request
I am not quite sure what you want here..

SQL is a totally different beast to Excel. Once you have learned SQL then you can implement it with VBA in Excel.. 

[Here for learning SQL](https://www.techonthenet.com/) in various flavours

[Here for learning VBA SQL](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=vba+sql) syntax
[Wise owl tutorials, ADO](https://youtu.be/HE9CIbetNnI). 

This is exactly what you're looking for. 

This is the first of his adodb tutorials. There's 3 I think specifically on interesting with sql database with excel. 
I like Lynda.com
ODBC data extracts using excel? Is that what you are doing? SQL is Sql is sql really, much the same from db to db - MS SQL db has some minor differences from Oracle but the structure is the same.
I've been using https://sqlbolt.com/ while at a desktop and https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.knowledify.sqlush when I'm away, just to keep practicing it.

If you're familiar with Excel/VBA, SQL shouldn't be difficult.
In addition to what others have said sqlzoo.com is a good resource for learning sql as well.

I've used both ADO in VBA and PowerQuery/GetData to use sql pulls in Excel, and I can tell you that PowerQuery is significantly easier and time saving. 
Cheers pal, appreciate the info
