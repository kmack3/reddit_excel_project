How did you become so good at excel?
Practice practice practice. Basically, I found ways to utilize excel for tasks i normally preformed and slowly built up a knowledge base. A lot of it is Googling and watching YouTube videos. Eventually i started messing around with VBA by recording macros and looking at the code.

Start simple by making a budget sheet and move on to things like calculating car loan interest rates or a ledger that does calculations. Look for projects to try on Google.
I've been working with spreadsheets since it was called multiplan and dos based. Meaning 1991. I pretty much have been doing excel every day since unless I was on vacation. That is 26 years - I should be able to be good at it. ;)

Practise is built on "this is a tool and supposed to be making my life easier", "if I can do it by hand, I can do it in here", "I should not be doing it manually, what is the pattern behind it?!", "how to freaking do that - what does google say?" and "hmmm. interesting how she did that. let me see if I can understand".

I also learned early on that there is a perfect solution which takes ages or the messy solution: make one line or just create extra columns which you then hide. 

There is a small amount of functions you really need for most cases - of the top of my head vlookup is the most complex to understand, managing formats (esp date and time), how much the clipboard is your friend and text manipulation and formulas like "countif".

There are several courses online - I think udemy even has a bunch of them for free or you can them cheap with their coupons.

And then it is again practice and "this is a tool supposed to make my life easier".

Certain things should come easy to you - you should be able to "see" what you need to do - and then play around until you have it. I for example worked for years in controlling and made perfect reporting systems with text manipulation through scripting languages, macros on mass etc.

However each month my boss would put up a postit with key numbers saying "it would be great if end of year number is actually this". He had a skill for numbers, I have a skill for excel. Same same - but different. ;) 

If you find that kind of mentor, you can also work with that person and show them files you work with - not for them to tell you how to do it, but if it is doable and which rough direction you should be going. then you go home and try it yourself. fail. course. google. fail again. rinse repeat. ;) 
I personally learn well with videos. ExcelIsFun's [2013 Highliine class](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrRPvpgDmw0nh4BBxqjcsnbB4ME4JjzfJ) as 50 videos, which I watched over the course of a month. The [2016 class has 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miUTG38k2mA). 
I had a very basic understanding of excel from school.  But mainly I found something I wanted to make.. for me it was tracking match information in Fifa.  Every year I made a new one making it more in depth each time.  Anything I couldn't do and wanted to do was always found online.  Find a project that you want to do. 
The brain is a massive processor that is dependent upon practice to improve.

The brain works by building pathways and then **reinforcing those pathways**.

Pathways can degrade if unused, which is why some people refer to the brain as a muscle. You gotta flex that muscle everyday to keep it ready for intellectually demanding tasks. The same way that a bodybuilder flexes muscles in the gym for the one day that a heavy weight may need lifting.

*New Wave* learning tries to kid everybody into thinking that **wrote learning** and **repetition** is terrible, but those are the fundamental strategies for learning and recollection.

You have to practice to get good at anything and memory is no different.

#Remember the three rules.
1. The brain learns through repetition.

1. The brain learns through repetition.

With excel, all you are remembering is formulas and how to arrange your data. So you need to write those formulas down and use them, create sample data and operate on it. Do it often and it will stick.

Don't stop because you feel bored or because you think you got it.

Just repeat it 10 times and then move on to the next one.

When you got it ingrained into your head that, "that is how it works", then you can start working on why it works.

The functions excel has, lends themselves well to a specific kind of data structure and some of the other functions involve taking junk data and rearranging it into that specific kind of data set that isn't junk.

All data is sorted into columnar categories and listed down the rows UNDER those column categories.

Date is never listed across columns, always in rows down a column.

So there is no easy pill to swallow, it is just learning and repeating.

Once you have understood what you gotta do. Go over to YouTube and search ExcelIsFun, that guy will get you good at excel in no time.
Hands down, I think the thing most people struggle with is relying too heavily on the mouse.  If you're trying to crank out some quality 'Sheets using a mouse, you're gonna have a bad time.  

Thankfully it's pretty easy to fix this if you're determined.  

* Google "excel keyboard shortcuts" and print out the best looking hits - *NB: Excel hotkeys have changed throughout the years, but legacy shortcuts still work.  Make sure you print and familiarize yourself with the hotkeys from 2003 & 2007 - they're quite usefule (I slam ALT+E+S, paste special, at least a hundred times a day).*  

* *Remember*, like 99.99% of all excel functionality can be accessed using **ONLY** the keyboard.  Pressing ALT once will display letters and/or numbers next to the functions on the Ribbon, then pressing said letters/numbers will let you navigate the various levels of options. Starting out, following the ALT+LETTER+LETTER sequencing can be slower than just using the mouse, but as you progress and all the functions become muscle memory, you will really FLY.  

* Unplug your mouse.  For real.  It's the only way to stop touching it. Only plug it back in if you can't figure out the hotkeys from your list or using the onscreen guide. Remove your F1 key, it will only cause you heartache. Make sure your keyboard has a "menu" key (usually next to the WIN/Alt keys) - its necessary for accessing menus that usually require a right-click.  


After that, only advice I can give is to stay curious.  If you're spreadsheeting and you think "there's gotta be a way to do x" or "I wonder if there's a more efficient way to do y", chances are there is.  Google it. I've probably picked up 99% of my Excel skills from the internet.
Took a class.  Boring answer I know.

Ask questions. Learn from others. I look for (almost) any opportunity to use and explore Excel
As you do tasks it's important to wonder if there is an easier way.  Once you ask that question Google the idea to see if a solution is out there.  There is almost always an easier, more efficient way once you do the research.  Example is summing or averaging data for a certain time/date range.  Of course you can do that manually but if you researched summing data for certain time/date range in excel you'll find lots of options to "automate" with useful formulas.  It helps to be curious and expect more from excel.
I am not as active here as some people, but I think it was because I learned it very young.  I remember learning and playing with excel in the 3rd grade.  Learning most of the advanced functions came from just experimenting and googling answers when I got stuck.
I first came into contact with Excel power users when I got my first trading floor developer job in 2004, working on an etrading market making system, and supporting rates market makers. The traders all had six screens with lots of stuff running. There were two things that every one of them had open all the time: Bloomberg and Excel. In Excel traders would be working up new trading ideas, ad hoc pricing and risk, PnL explain, even entire automated trading system. The spreadsheets would use several addins for real time and historical prices, quotes, trades, and risk measures. I coded an addin myself to plug trader spreadsheets into the market making infrastructure. Some of those guys had awesome Excel skills. They could be voice trading on their squawk boxes, watching prices, talking to their colleagues and editing a pricing spreadsheet all at the same time. It was the classic illustration of agile problem solving by creative power users, they inspired to learn more about Excel, and I learned a huge amount from them...
The people at my first job had no idea how Excel worked so I did all the work which involved using it. Started automating things here and there and have since worked up to bigger and better things 
Assigned projects where the skill I knew was either not enough or painfully manual and long. Made me research alternative tricks and techniques. Discovered new features, new ways to use formulas, etc. Getting exposure to new projects and tasks that you never did before helps. Even if you are putting together the same spreadsheet everyday, that's an opportunity to learn about macros and VBA.
Got put on a pointless late shift with heavy internet restrictions at my previous job. Had to keep busy somehow.
I sacrificed a goat to the gods of finance and exchanged the souls of IT staff for VBA knowledge. Not the normal way,  but they weren't using them  
at work
My Excel capabilities have improved quite a lot since I started signing up to ModelOff to get my ass kicked in Excel once a year.

Lurking in r/Excel has also worked wonders. Especially if you're the one answering questions. There's no better way to learn something than to teach it yourself.

And of course, you need to practice. That should really go without saying.
Fake it until you make it. Always be willing to say yes to projects to expand your talents. I know a lot of people may not be ready to do this fully but I can tell you the stuff I did 5 years ago I was proud of at the time, the stuff I look back on now from 5 years ago I can't believe how inefficient I was and the stuff I'm doing today I'm extremely proud of - in 5 years rinse, wash, repeat.
Excellent advice. I am at an Excel class that my job paid for and I can tell you that you always learn new things no matter how long you've been using Excel.
100% this.  I would just think of something that I want to do, like pull a column in from another workbook.  Then I would start searching on Google for how to accomplish this.  After awhile, you get tired of having to manually do this everytime, so then you start looking into VBA and how to automate these steps for this one little action.  If you take this approach for all the little excel projects you have to do over time, it's exactly like u/Aguywhoknowsstuff says... you slowly build up a knowledge base and it just becomes second nature.
I'll definitely use that, thank you! I recently graduated from my university and one thing I regret is not taking some advanced excel courses, because a lot of firms look for proficient excel knowledge. 
Likewise, though I was Claris Works on my Mac LCII in 1992. I just kept looking for things spreadsheets could do - searching for solutions, treating them like puzzles and design challenges. If I had a specific spreadsheet job, id go out of my way to add features, automate processes, explore new functions.
Wow, some very advanced users I have commenting on my post. Thank you for your explanation and giving me a sense of direction and motivation for this. I can definitely say my boss is a numbers guy, being the president of sales and marketing at my company. Lol. I'll take a look into at site you mentioned. I greatly appreciate your feedback! :)
I will definitely be looking at these in my free time, thank you very much for linking them! 
Care to share a couple of lines about your Fifa project? This project sounds fun
Not really! A class online or in person? Any tips on the most important formula in your opinion?
Being able to word what I want in google is definitely a challenge for me, especially while at the same time learning some advanced excel lingo. Thank you my friend! :D
Did they go to the bathroom or just do their blow at their desks?
Dang, what a cursed way to learn it; but you learned it lol
Sounds like something I could shadow! Tell me does the goat have to be a specific breed or any goat will suffice? 
Nice, that's how I feel, I've done projects not too long ago and I've been learning so much and refining the projects from their inefficient state. However, I know I can keep refining!
That's what I like to do too, I'm fairly new with excel; however, I love exploring what I can and always am finding myself refining my work into more efficient ways. I just wish I knew more lol. 
A week long in-class course.  Without a doubt the most useful class I have ever taken. Learnt more useful information in that class than my entire MPA.  

Most useful thing for me was pivot tables.  In my current job I do a ton of line-by-line data downloads, so being able to so easily manipulate the data to get summaries is invaluable.   
LOL! No, I never saw any direct evidence of coke use by traders. Yes, they were focused, intense and occasionally aggressive. But I never saw any sniffing, twitching, grinding of teeth or traces of white powder.
Upside - In my new job, excel skills get the same reaction that people had on David Blane's street magic!
