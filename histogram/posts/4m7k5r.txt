Has anyone got a Euro 2016 or decent Fantasy Football (Soccer) Spreadsheet that they'd like to share?
This would be awesome to have. Noone in my office has proposed it yet! 
What do you want the sheet to do? I'm game for building something for euros
I may have something tomorrow.
If there's enough interest I'll set up an /r/excel league somewhere -- although that might make people less inclined to share their spreadsheets!
So, I've found a file from 2 years ago that a co-worker did. I had to translate it to English. Is [this](http://bit.ly/EuroExcel) what you are looking for?

EDIT: I have removed the link.
How did it turn out? 
FYI reddit blocks shortlinks.

Also, your name is visible in the Dropbox page.
I replied to my own comment with link.
Thanks for the heads up,I will look into it!
