How to count a value/character in a row but resets to "0" once new value/character is introduced in that row and restart counting old value/character?
Not sure if this helps, but this will record your current streak in Row 1, where "Y" is a success and "N" is a failure.

`=MAX(SUMPRODUCT(MAX((A1:AZ1="Y")*COLUMN(A1:AZ1)))-SUMPRODUCT(MAX((A1:AZ1="N")*COLUMN(A1:AZ1))),0)`
Unfortunately it gives me an error.
What's the error? Did you copy and paste directly or did you try to modify it? Works fine for me.

Check it!
Help me out with what you're going for here -- what's a "win" and what's a "loss" in each row?
"o" is for win and loss is "x" as they should appear with their respective color. Sorry for the delay

For the Prayers row:  
`=MAX(SUMPRODUCT(MAX((H3:ZH3="o")*COLUMN(A3:ZA3)))-SUMPRODUCT(MAX((H3:ZH3="x")*COLUMN(A3:ZA3))),0)`

Drag down to the other rows.
