I heard that until a few years ago Apple primarily used Excel as the basis for their ERP. Is that true? I'd also like some other interesting statistics/facts about Excel for a presentation.
You could always check out the European spreadsheet risk interest group website:

143.82% of all US companies have errors in their Excel workbooks due to [floating-point arithmetic](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/78113).
Here are the two AMAs

This is way, way out of date, but I worked part time at a computer store that sold Apples right before the first Macintosh came out (late 1983). A couple of times I was on the phone to Apple, either registering someone's purchase or signing them up with Apple Credit, and the "computer was down." I had to laugh, and asked them, "is it Apple?" No, it was IBM.

Apple used IBM.
I interviewed at apple recently and they used excel for pretty much everything according to the team interviewing me.

Weird interview though. Only company in California where I was actually the only non indian guy in the office. Usually its 30% to 70%.

That. That is amazing.
TIL I am not the only one who makes mistakes.
Great resource, thanks!

Truly. The spreadsheet horror stories are magnificent:

"At one point R&R set cell L51 equal to AVERAGE(L30:L44) when the correct procedure was AVERAGE(L30:L49). They left Denmark, Canada, Belgium, Austria, and Australia out of the average. When you fix the Excel error, a -0.1 percent growth rate turns into 0.2 percent growth."

Horror, indeed!

Well, that error literally is the difference between recommending high public debt (and the services and tax rates that implies) or not, and the difference of 0.3% amounts to $50 billion per year for the US. It's a huge, embarrassing error at the very, very end of a long, long analysis.
