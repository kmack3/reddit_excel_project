Every Excel shortcut you will ever need

Jackpot!
Holy crap. Many of these, even very useful ones, are completely new to me. I love this feature:

* Alternate between displaying cell values and displaying cell formulas:	 CTRL+`

I've also compiled a list of shortcuts (& functions) in this training workbook:  http://excelexposure.com/workbook/

Hope it's helpful.
