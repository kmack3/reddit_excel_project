Using excel in *proper* split screen (Windows).
FYI, if you have Excel pinned to your taskbar, you can shift-click the Excel icon to start another instance of Excel.
The unfortunate part, is you can't copy paste (special - otherwise it treats it as a cut) across windows with 2007-2010. Only in 2013 did they bring back the ability to copy-paste.
its native in 2013+ 
also if you hold the windows key and the arrow button it will stick it to the sides  (more useful for when running multiple screens)
This is a registry hack I found out about several years ago. It worked in Win7 with Office 2010. Please be cautious and backup your registry before you try these. I haven't used them in years, so it might not even work anymore.

1). Open: Registry Editor from C:\Windows\System32
Navigate to: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Excel.Sheet.12\shell\Open\command and change the value for command (right click command and select 'Modify') to: xb'BV6!!!!!!!!!MKKSkEXCELFiles>VijqBof(Y8'w!FId1gLQ /p "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\EXCEL.EXE" /e "%1"
 
2). In Registry Editor navigate to: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Excel.Sheet.12\shell\Open\ddeexec and rename 'ddeexec' to: ddeexec2
Tip if your still using 2010 upgrade to 2013 its a whole other world of joy. My company though still runs 2010 but they are upgrading soon.
Or even middle-click. 
I love the 'tabs for excel' add-in, I highly recommend you check it out 
Cheers for this! 
You also cannot do a Lookup across the separate instances. 
Sorry, should have specified. This is excel 2010. 
This feature changed my life. But for some reason, it works very differently in Windows 10 - now it wants to stick the window to a corner of the screen, which is way too small with W10's huge interface. Anyone know why it changed, and how to change it back?
Turn off numlock and hold windows key and use those as well
It's in work that I am forced to use 2010 unfortunately. No word of upgrading.
This. Click with your scroll wheel to open any icon on your taskbar in a new window. 
I know Windows 10 has the new 'Snap Assist'. Not 100% sure if any of the settings would interfere with Excel, [un]fortunately I dont run windows at home so I cant verify, but it's a possibility.

Only if you have not customized your mouse buttons.
I don't mean just Excel. It happens with any program. Found out it's called 2x2 Aero Snap or something like that. Just gotta find a way to restore the "classic" snap or whatever you'd call it.
Only if your computer is not on fire.
Only if you have a computer
