How to return to the top of selected data
`Ctrl+Backspace` returns focus to the active cell where you have scrolled (or selected in a formula) away from the active cell... [see here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utrQddPrLYs)

edit: changing this post to Pro Tip - its a great tip!
Hit "Ctrl"+"." A few times to cycle through each corner of the selected range.
Life changer. Thank you!
Oh, I see. That's exactly what I was trying to do, so I guess I didn't think about trying to get back there if you've done some intermediate step

This is a pro tip! Thx!
