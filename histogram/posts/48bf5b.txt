Add a Live Updating Loading Bar to your Excel VBA
Great tip, but really should have the code on the page, rather than just the link to download a sample, some won't download from unknown sources... 
It's a cool trick but I was always under the impression that this will make your macro slower.
Just installed this on the company dashboard I'm building, works great.  Thanks for the tip!
I have added the code to the page - thank you!
Surprisingly, not by much. It's a static update once whenever you want, not constantly so it doesn't add any noticeable time to most code. 
Ah, nice!  Great code!  Thanks!
I tried adding the code from the page to my Excel file but it doesn't seem to include the code for f_load. 
Next time I create a large macro I'll consider adding this. Thanks for adding the tip! 
Sorry for the delay.

If you download the entire file, all the code you need is in there.
I did that. Thanks.
