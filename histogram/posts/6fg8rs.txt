Simple VBA Crashes Excel in Mac
If you run this below row 32767, you should get a runtime error due to using Integer rather than Long for SRow.

Maybe Excel for Mac handles the VBA differently, but under Windows you could just use

    Sub CopyRow2()
      With ActiveCell.EntireRow
        .Copy
        .Insert Shift:=xlDown
      End With
      Application.CutCopyMode = False
    End Sub

Alternatively, it may be a recalculation problem following the insert operation. If the macro above still has problems, try the following.

    Sub CopyRow3()
      With Application
        .ScreenUpdating = False
        .Calculation = xlCalculationManual
      End With
      With ActiveCell.EntireRow
        .Copy
        .Insert Shift:=xlDown
      End With
      With Application
        .CutCopyMode = False
        .Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
      End With
    End Sub
