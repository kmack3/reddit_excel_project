Excel Skill
I don't know about everyone else here, but I think that the most important skill in Excel is the ability to learn how to solve problems. 

You don't have to know which formula you need to use to solve for X, you just need the capacity to seek it out. 

For all intents and purposes, Googling something for 10 minutes to arrive at a working solution is almost as effective as knowing the answer by heart.
I think it's a nice *idea*, but probably difficult in practice.

I mean, let's say the test was 10 questions long (which I don't think is nearly enough to adequately assess someone). *Which* questions could you possibly choose that would accurately rank everyone in the sub from 1 - 10? I can't imagine how anyone would do that. I'd guess you'd need at least 30 questions (minimum) to start gauging that metric, at which point most people will be too lazy to attempt it in the first place.

Or if they're already embarrassed about their level of ability, they'll just avoid it because they don't need someone else telling them "yeah, you're dumb".
I used to believe I was an intermediate user, but after entering the workforce I've realised how few office admins have any clue how to use excel appropriately. I currently have seek.com sending me 20 jobs for the keyword excel every few days so I can gauge what recruiters believe to be "Advanced" etc to get an idea of what sort of skill level I am. Expectations are disturbingly low. As a result I would suggest there are a lot of levels above advanced like expert, master, very advanced, wizard from the 5th dimension etc.

Being good with excel is more about being good at mathematics, logic, problem solving and online research than knowing the syntax to every formula. It's how you APPLY it that counts.

Take VLOOKUPS for example. In every course I have done that has touched excel, vlookups were taught. The always teach it the same stupid way. A single formula used to return a corresponding value from a table. Pretty much useless. However, if you use any kind of lookup formula to match two sets of data by a common delimiter (column heading / type, key identifier etc) it becomes incredibly useful. I didn't use VLOOKUP for years after learning it because I didn't have a use for it the way I was taught.......until some numpty sent through a revised store list with different names for the same stores. VLOOKUP helped me almost instantly match them by suburb, whereas coworkers previously did it by bloody sorting and eyesight. Down the line I've applied it to all kinds of things, like a template for automatic crosschecking of invoices.

So if you know what you want excel to do, and have an idea of how it might do it, you can hit-up google or /r/excel for advice, and then learn from it.
You can do SO MUCH with Excel I doubt there is someone out there that is a real expert in all its functions.
    
A test would have to cover all these different areas of expertise but would ultimately be meaningless.
    
I know next to nothing about some parts but in my field I'm doing alright.
I think the ClippyPoints accomplishes that (that's the number after our usernames in comments), and of course the voting system built into Reddit. And along with /u/The_Helper, I agree it would be hard to gauge expertise. I took a quick assessment test I saw here recently, and I got a question wrong because I couldn't [name what word/label is in this last tab](http://i.imgur.com/K5GpE7j.png). Now sure, a true die-hard expert (like an author or certified MS expert) would know this, but the fact is I never need to use Protection in my spreadsheets so I don't ever go to that tab - and importantly, I skip over the questions about protection because I know I don't know too much about it (nothing outside of what the OP could Google anyway).

But I wouldn't say I'm untrustworthy - I mean, I helped over 600 people in the last 9 months (not including the hundreds of ones that don't award the Clippy Point), and I nearly always include screenshots to show how to accomplish the task the OP is asking about.
I like the spirit of the idea, but in practice it will be very difficult to implement.   There seems to be two types of posters...the ones who want to copy/paste in the exact formula given to them and the ones who want to understand the formula and why it does what it does.

In the case of the former, their level doesn't really matter.  In the case of the latter, those folks will read up on the functions or just ask why/how something works.  
in the UK, i know they have a somewhat standardizes manual that sort of groups excel skill into a few categories. It was posted on here a while back. It had a large list of different features and skills that each category should have some level of understanding of, and which ones were necessary. It was pretty cool. 
Because Excel can be used for *SO MANY* things, it's really difficult to make any sort of test that's representative.

My best attempt would be:

* Develop a LONG test looking at dozens of different aspects of using Excel.

* Have a set of people take the entire test (probably taking multiple hours) and see how well people do on a per-question basis.

* Allow others to take a shortened version of the test.  It could have an adaptive feature similar to the NWEA MAP test administered to grade school students.  The test length and difficulty is adaptive based on whether you get the previous question correct or incorrect.  Unfortunately unless you give every person every question, it's difficult to know how much any random person knows compared to everyone else.  With NWEA, the output is a range of estimated score +/- 1 standard deviation, which isn't all that great statistically, and they are asking approximately 50 questions of each student.  (https://www.nwea.org/blog/2015/making-sense-of-standard-error-of-measurement/)

It'd be an interesting challenge, and I'm not sure how it would all turn out.
basically, I'd say there are about 4 main classes or tiers of users- 

basic users- those who can find a value and generate a line or bar graph by putting values in columns or rows and then inserting a graph and swiping the values to include. This user can probably navigate to different sheets, and might be able to use basic formulas, like =sum and =average

second tier is a user that uses excel for simple functions regularly as part of their job. They are comfortable with many simple functions, like =min() =max() and some others. They know how to drag formulas around and use relative references, as well as static references using "$" in the cell references. They may know a few more of the hotkeys in excel for common tasks, like 'end' followed by an arrow key. this user might use a lot of the functions from the formula tab for financial stuff or other applications.

the next tier of user is the user who can do all of the above, but has an understanding of more complicated/powerful functions like =vlookup() and =match(), =indirect() and stuff like that. Basically just the previous tier with a better understanding of how to navigate a sheet and use more of the functions. this user may make a lot of use of the add-ins for data analysis, or solver. 

The final tier, in my opinion, are the users who use VBA. This is a very large/infinite skill range, as coding becomes a very creative thing. Some folks are better at finding more efficient ways to do things with code, and so the skill becomes impossible to measure effectively. These are the "wizards," as VBA unlocks seemingly limitless potential possibilities and functions of excel. If you can imagine it, you can find a way to write code to do it pretty much, barring memory limitations. 

the thing is that many users kind of fall in a place that straddles these categories. I can do a fair bit of simple VBA stuff, but not nearly as efficiently or simply as some other people who know about more arguments and how they work. I also struggle with some of the weird excel functions like =offset() and things like that... so it's hard to place somebody exactly. 
This 1000 times over. The difference between a basic user and an advanced user is when you start to make excel do the work for you. When you get to the point that you can pull data out of a data base, paste it into a sheet, and get all the info you want from a template you pre-made; that's when you are on your way.

Yes, this is it for me, totally. I sometimes wonder if Excel's ease of use actually works against it here - it's so easy to fill worksheets with complex formulas and feel like you're achieving something, but much more important is the question of whether you're actually solving your problem, and whether your results are useful.

It doesn't automatically follow that just because a person can do complex lookups or write macros, they can also solve problems. That's why I've always thought that just 'knowing Excel' isn't really much of a claim. What can you actually *do* with that knowledge?
It's not necessarily going to be a completely objective test that will show your absolute skill level with Excel. It will be more of an indicator where that person is at, to let others know how to talk to said person in their replies. I've asked questions before and people think I don't know anything and said nothing helpful to me because they thought it was beyond me.

As far as people not wanting to do it because they're dumb, it can also be a training exercise as we can have the answers and how they're obtained and what the thought process is that goes into solving such a problem. I don't think anyone is inherently dumb because they don't know how to use Excel. The mere fact that they're seeking answers to their questions shows intelligence enough for me.

Maybe you're right that not a lot of people would want to take the test, though. That I don't have anything but instinct to go off of, but I would imagine there are some that would.
What does a Pivot Table do? (Analyzes information by selective representation)

Should a formula be used when a macro would suffice? (Trick question, macros can destroy source information, formulas are preferable for manipulating data because they can be evaluated and precedents/dependents can be traced.)

What three things are needed for a SumIF? (Sum range, criteria range and a criteria)

Name one thing that makes Index and Match preferable to VLookUp? (Index and match can look to the left)

If I enter a 12:00 into excel and changed the formatting from Short Time to General, what would excel show me as a value? (0.5)

What date is shown when the value is 0? (00.01.1900)

These are some questions that I have asked people and their answers are very telling when it comes to excel knowledge.
i finally learned how to use match and index recently... holy shit. flip-turned my world upside down. 

im adding and subtracting matrices by selecting them from a pair of dropdowns now, and it kicks so much ass. It's awesome to make a sum matrix and be able to select two matrices to add together to generate it and be able to see the graph it creates. I have been doing some work with solar power estimation and building power demand load curves to generate a theoretical day for each month of the year, and it's cool to be able to select like, P90 values for solar production at a particular orientation and compare to the P10 values of the building over the observed timeframe and see what the resultant curve would look like... and then switch to some other statistically relevant values and just kinda watch it move around. Helps us determine what kind of results we can realistically expect to produce for clients, and then be able to feel better about doing performance agreements and such. 
you just KNOW there are all kinds of weird functionalities and VBA argumetns and stuff that were added in like, a decade ago by some random dev from microsoft that have been forgotten about.

As I see it, there are three different major areas of excel: data entry including formatting, formulae use, and VBA.

Out of a score of 10:

0-3 data entry & formatting

4-7 formulae use

8-10 VBA


No one test will give you the exact amount of knowledge someone has, but if a test were devised that at least allowed us to know where a person stands on this sort of scale, we would be able to accurately tailor a response to a question to their level.

For more detail, the bottom of each range would be the most basic actions and the top of the range would be knowing how to implement one's knowledge to solve problems independently.

I think people are thinking that I'm trying to find out everything someone knows about Excel and that's not what I was after, just an overall indicator. I wouldn't be able to assume anything about the person except the fact they can change a cell color with conditional formatting, they have used multiple formulas in conjunction with each other to solve a problem, and/or can write small pieces of code in VBA. At the least we would know if the person even knows you can enter a formula into Excel, having met a lot of people for which this isn't true.

And again, it can be a learning tool just as much as an indicator, highlighting the most frequently used tools in Excel for the majority of users.
I do understand where you're coming from, but I just struggle to see it working well in practice.

While it's easy to say that a test "isn't objective", it's very difficult to take a test and not *feel* that it's objective. That's the whole reason for doing a test in the first place, as far as 99% of people are concerned.

And even if that hurdle were overcome, I still don't know how you'd actually choose the questions. Given the sheer volume of functions / tools / behaviours in Excel, it would be a mess trying to choose a representative set that doesn't bias one particular group/profession over another.
Firstly, I would challenge the relevance of some of those questions. Knowing the specific 'Excel epoch date' seems hardly relevant at all. All you need to know is that dates are also represented by numbers. Similarly, asking if a formula/macro is "preferable" is entirely context-specific. While you rightly argue that formulas allow you trace dependants and so forth, that's not necessarily representative of the specific situation the user faces.

Secondly, how do you turn those broad, probing questions into a test that can be automatically graded and ranked against everybody else? All of those questions could be answered in different ways, using different terminology, etc, and all of them equally valid (or invalid). And if they're wrong, they could be wrong for different reasons, highlight different points of confusion, etc.

Thirdly - if you check out the /new page right now - you'll see that even if we *could* quantify those long-form answers somehow, they'd have almost *no* relevance to any of the questions actually being asked. They would literally be taking a test that has nothing to do with their situation.
> What three things are needed for a SumIF? (Sum range, criteria range and a criteria)

Just an FYI, and to show why tests can be tricky, SUMIF only requires two arguments. The third is optional (hence the brackets around the argument when the helper list shows up), and is only needed if you want sum range to be different than the criteria range.
Now THAT is using excel lol. Very practical. I've being using it in a similar method (but less advanced purpose / maths) for instant graphing of stock products against stores. 600 stores with 45 different products. Dump the data in with a row per store / product combination (600*45 for a full set), and the sheet grabs the values and places them in a cross-tab table with yes or no. Then CountIfs are used to get the numeric totals, and it graphs the results by store and by product.
I love clippy points =[

Seriously?

Why are they such bullshit? How are they poorly administered?
I agree that his examples where poor, or at least very specific (like two on datetime internals). Really, instead of a test, I'd rather like to see some general topics and use cases that people could use to gauge their level. Because excel sees use in different fields for different purposes, that might even have to be reflected too. It's obvious that such a test soon will be quite difficult to make.

What I and a couple friends do as and litmus test is typically to ask if they can do pivot tables (lots of people fail that), the various lookup formulas (same), VBA and macros (again, few know about it but the use case is limited so reveals less about them) and finally ask them general questions about spreadsheet workbook design and what they have in their "portfolio". If they know more than a few shortcuts that's typically also a point in their favor (though I'm not if the school that you should be totally mouse free).
People who don't know the epoch date tend to use this as a date "4.8.2016", which is a version, not a date.
Yes, and the order must be (criteria range, criteria, [optional sum range])
It's because he has one.
Well, they rely on people actually giving them out once you solve their problem lol, some OPs are great about it, others "forget".   
Mods can fix it if the OP replies, in no uncertain terms, that something was a solution, but didn't award a point. Not to mention that it usually requires follow-up on the 2nd or 3rd day of all unsolved posts etc. and we aren't all good at getting that done (speaking about myself here, the other mods are awesome.) But it's still a judgement call that we'd rather not have to be making. 

Clippy points are mostly just there for fun, and as a way for people to show appreciation, while helping to keep the sub clean (whenever a person replies with solution verified, their post also gets tagged as "solved" automatically.)  
They are generally a rough indicator of your activity on the sub (as /u/rnelsonee is proof of! I think I've gotten... 40 points in the time he has become #1 :D) We did some more thorough analytics earlier on and # of points correlates very strongly with # of comments on the sub. But we try to be careful not to over-emphasize the accumulation of them too much. Some people get a kick out of getting points and that's awesome, others hate the "gamification", hopefully we manage to keep it fairly balanced. 

A user who posts a different / improved solution to an already solved post and maybe doesn't get a reply from OP, is still contributing to the sub. Someone who makes an interesting discussion thread is contributing. Someone who uploads a user template is contributing. None of them get clippy points for those contributions. 

That's why we just do a monthly status update and why /u/semicolonx2 is nice enough to maintain a "milestone" list in the sidebar, rather than a "high score", and why it's okay if some people hate them :) 

I respectfully disagree.

No-one needs to recite "00/01/1900" in order to work with dates in Excel. Thousands (millions?) of users do it every single day without issue. You only need to understand that dates = numbers, and that the further back you go, the closer to 0 you'll get. Knowing the specific date doesn't necessarily make you any better/worse at using them in a formula than anyone else.

In fact, I would argue that even many professionals don't bother storing the exact date in their head, because it's so rarely useful.

Questions like this are a classic case of "teaching to the test", rather than "understanding a concept".
In this topic, /u/the_helper doesn't realize that excel treats this "12.6.2016" as text.

Knowing the epoch date means the the user UNDERSTANDS HOW EXCEL CALCULATES DATES. This is vital for doing any calculation between two times and dates, especially over midnight.

13.6.2016 16:55  - 12.6.2016 14:55 = #VALUE

Whereas,

			
13/6/2016 14:56 - 12/6/2016 14:55 = 1.000694444

Now that is quite a significant difference.

One can calculate minutes and hours as a number from the second one using the following, very simple formula.

    =--TEXT(B8-A8,"[h]:mm")

There is going to be a massive headache to get the first example to calculate the time the person was on shift, and I have seen people put very complicated formulas together to figure it out and get a very wrong answer. A wrong answer that results in people being paid wrongly.

So the fact a person knows excel's Epoch date, not only tells me that they know it is a number, but more specifically, that it is a number represented in days and that they will be able to **create formulas with that in mind** and may give the clue that times are past the decimal point.

The reason for the time question is that the date question doesn't indicate whether the user has connected those two dots, because many people are self taught and haven't.
> In this topic, /u/the_helper doesn't realize that excel treats this "12.6.2016" as text.

No, /u/MarxIzalias, that is categorically false. I understand *entirely*, and if you read my post history in this sub, you will see I've explicitly talked about it on several occasions.

My point is that very few people *need* to know the exact date of "01/01/1900" in order to understand the concept.

The question that you proposed merely asks a user to recite a specific epoch date. The answer to that question DOES NOT prove one way or the other whether they can/cannot use it correctly in a formula. You can *infer* information from it (in one direction only), but you absolutely cannot prove the negative.

As I already said, thousands/millions of people successfully manipulate dates in Excel every day, without having memorised that specific date. They simply understand the *concept*, which is perfectly sufficient.

Let me ask you the question in reverse (no peeking allowed, you have to answer these off the top of your head):

1. What is the epoch date in MATLAB?
2. What is the epoch date in COBOL?
3. What is the epoch date in MUMPS?
4. What is the epoch date in Pascal?
5. What is the epoch date in Google Sheets?

Does that mean that you fundamentally don't understand how dates work in any of those systems? Of course not! It simply means that you haven't memorised that *particular* piece of esoteric trivia. But you understand the **concept** just fine.
>"My point is that very few people need to know the exact date of "01/01/1900" in order to understand the concept."

The 0 date is 00/01/1900.

But don't worry, you only failed one of the basic tests I posited in my post.

[I guess you don't really know how to work with dates in excel.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4PnXfXtoos)
Yes, I made a mistake in my typing. I'm literally hitler.

You seem to be neglecting the actual point, however.
Which as we all know, is 1000x worse than figuratively Hitler, you're practically a genocidal maniac at this point.
