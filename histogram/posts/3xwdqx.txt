How can I eliminate the PIVOT TABLE from always reformatting when data is refreshed. And NO it is not by selecting "Preserve cell formatting on update" or deselecting "Autofit column widths on update"
Right click, field value settings, then bottom button "number Format"

Setting the field format this way makes it stick 
OP I have this same problem.  Let us know if either of the two solutions solved the problem and maybe expand on the solutions.
Have you tried un-checking "adjust column width" ?
I'd set up a custom pivot table style if I was you, I'd guess that you've applied a format to part of a pivot table component but not the whole thing.  
  
On refresh, the default for that area is still the old format etc...  
  
using a style should circumvent that
Thanks.  Setting up a custom pivot table style is the way to go.  However there are still a couple of regions of the Pivot Table that I cannot seem to format properly.  Mainly around the borders.  But this is good enough for me for the time being. Thanks!
