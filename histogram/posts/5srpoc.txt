Converting between decimal minutes and mm:ss (e.g. 5.5 would become 5:30)
Divide by 24 and format as time.  
All the time presets come with seconds. If you don't want that and just to leave it in hh:mm,  
In the format calls window, select custom, and manually enter hh:mm.  
Alternatively, use  
> =TEXT(A1/24,"hh:mm")  

This way you don't need to mess with formatting.

Divide the time value by 24..

Custom format the cell `[hh]:mm` to prevent hours running over into days when over 24 hours.

Just to point out your actually converting this into hours and minutes,  which might not be a problem, but if you need to do other things with the data you may run into some issues.  To get minutes and seconds devide by 24 then 60.

    =TEXT(A1/24/60,"[mm]:ss")

Or 

    =A1/24/60

Format as [mm]:ss
Thank you! I ended up making a simple distance/speed/time/pace converter as well and this really helped! :)
