Thank you, this is so close to what I would like to do. How would you make it so the only sheet that is saved as a PDF is "Report Sheet"? As it stands now, it is saving the entire workbook as a PDF .
Thank you. My apologies, first time poster, it should be correctly formatted now.

Sorry for late reply.

So you want to only PDF the "Report Sheet" and not the other tabs of the project correct?
I believe all you'd need to do is change line 10 to

    ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Report Sheet").Select
Oh wow, can't believe I didn't see that. Thank you!
