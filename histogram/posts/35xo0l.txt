[Repost r/gaming] Office boredom is real
I spent a good hour making an 16-bit version of my company's logo in Excel and make it a point to make it make it the first page in all the spreadsheets I send out. At some point, someone is going to take it and send it out to a customer and my work will be complete. 

Other than that, I like to get sports teams' colors in RGB and make their colors into the themes for my charts. I present, the [Chicago Blackhawks sales trend report!](http://i.imgur.com/62nUHAF.png). The colors of the chart match the colors of the [Blackhawk feathers](http://i.imgur.com/bIPgguy.png).
I wrote a VBA function to read a bitmap image and draw it on the spreadsheet with each pixel being a cell
One Friday I was working on a spreadsheet someone created that had heavy use of borders on one sheet.  I realized that whenever this sheet was up on my monitor, it created a barely audible sound.  I then realized that the frequency of the sound changed depending on the row height.  I then created a new workbook and spent the better part of a day subtly adjusting the row height and borders across several sheets so that as I clicked from one sheet to the next, it played Mary Had a Little Lamb.  
Not exactly ART but I created pretty crappy High/Low card game using Excel/VBA last week when the week's work ran out...complete with sprites and sounds (warning: sounds nsfw).

Here's the dl link (it's a .zip file...not sure how to prove I didn't put any malware in it): https://www.dropbox.com/s/1ix6vv7tzxdrhnj/HiLo%20%28New%20User%29.zip?dl=0

If you look at the code you'll notice I got lazy about 35% of the way through and stopped commenting or following my own vba standards...it's alright I learned a lot in the process.
Can confirm that the boredom is real. Which explains why Reddit is such a great website, timesinks like nothing else. Except maybe WoW.
I have a lot of excel drawings: https://mega.co.nz/#F!M8gHDJBJ!1pFQ98I2J1fbgl9JSzd1xg
Several years ago, during a couple of weeks when I had nothing to do, I wrote a fully functional Tetris in Excel using VBA.

It's not so fully-functional since Excel 2007, sadly. I kinda fixed it adding some DoEvents here and there, but I think it was not the latest version of the file, it's still a little broken.
Do share :)
