Hey, I see you missed a few posts, I can help with that! (2016-06-27)
This looks pretty identical to the Commentless Bot that I had /u/pandemic21 make for me for /r/findareddit! I'm glad to see that it's being put to use here. :) 
Woo! Clippy is *back*!
Yay for people using my bots

I might have to actually comment my code and tighten my code up if other people are going to implement them, lol
It is not, this one was written by /u/GoldenSights.

We had this running every week a few months back ([I think January was the last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/405iys/hey_i_see_you_missed_a_few_posts_i_can_help_with/)), but we stopped when we changed Clippys machine, and I fired up the old machine this morning and it ran the scheduled task for it.

Not sure if we are going to keep it or not.

I had /u/Pandemic21 write me one very similar for /r/FindaReddit a few weeks ago and we've been using it weekly. It's been very instrumental in catching threads without responses and bringing them to the community's attention. I lump it in with our [weekly report](https://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/4pn67d/rfindareddit_weekly_report_for_the_week_of/) now and every time I re-run that week I find that the number of submissions that are commentless has gone down by a good bit. 

Interesting how similar they look! The only difference being that yours shows a "Number of Comments" column. 
Really I think the only reason we stopped running it was because of the new machine Clippy was running on, I had forgotten to move it over, as well as the [abandoned](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/search?q=flair%3A%27abandoned%27&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all#inf) one...  which apparently ran this morning as well...

Ours would mark anything abandoned if after 30 days it was still listed as "Waiting on OP", the missed a post was week to week
