Carry Around My Excel Settings?
I haven't tested this, but to to Excel Options, Quick Access Toolbar, Import/Export and save as a Excel Customizations.exportedUI. Then get that into your C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office folder (manually or with a syncing program) on the other computers. AppData is hidden, so turn on hidden folders or just type that in directly. That might work.

Other settings are saved as Book1.xltx in the folder specified in Excel Options -> Advanced -> "At startup, open all files in..."'s folder. And of course other preferences are stored in the registry, so you'd need a tool to export those as .reg files.
Get everything how you like it and save as an Excel template - xlst or xlsm in the XLStart folder on your different machines -
