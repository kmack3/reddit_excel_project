Is there a way to simplify this long chain of SUMIF's?
If you are converting all the numbers between 1-8 to 1, then it looks like you aren't really summing, but just counting?

    =COUNTIFS(E2:E149,">0",E2:E149,"<9")
You are just counting the number of cells with a value greater than zero.  =countif(range,">0")
Picky: this would include numbers with fractional parts. To count only integers,

    =SUMPRODUCT(COUNTIF(E2:E149,{1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8}))
Yeah, thanks. I just couldn't find the function. 
You should post "Solution Verified" now so aelios gets credit - for good etiquette.
No worries, it was a creative use of the function.  Took me a sec to figure out what you were trying to do.
