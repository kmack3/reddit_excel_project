Keep Excel from hiding my leading apostrophe
Can you just have them enter the string with no quotes and concatenate them in later?
I'm not at a computer to test this right now, but I *think* changing the input cell's format type to "Text" might achieve what you want. 
Could your users just enter the single quotation mark twice at the start? That way one appears in the cell but you will have 2 at the start. You might have to adjust your code for it?

''ABC123' will show as 

'ABC123'

But the formula bar will show the exact cell entry as ''ABC123'

I think excel works in the manner that ' is a formula or something (sorry I can't recall the exact reason) so it hides it
Follow these steps. 

* 1. Select the Cell
* 2. Press Ctrl + 1
* 3. Choose Custom
* 4. Enter this format in the text box under 'Type': _*??_ ;_ '@'_ 
* 5. Click Ok. 

Now, enter all possible values in this cell. You can see a single quote added to text automatically.
Note: If you don't want automatic quotes getting added to the text, then delete the single quote after the symbol @ in the format.
Wouldn't =trim() work?
I had it set up to add the apostrophes in, in the code, but if they enter multiple values, then they have to make it like PW34W', 'MC24U', 'P23H4 and I have to have a weird instruction thing by the cell telling them to leave off the first and last apostrophe, which is equally as weird as warning them about the disappearing leading apostrophe. 
itsbecause sometimes you want a zero to be seen in front of a number i.e. ZIP codes or phone numbers

0175987654321 will be 175987654321

so either you format the cell as text first and input the number second or you just use '0175987654321, which is way faster usually. at least for short notes.
> ' is a formula or something

It basically forces "text" view of the column's data. So a leading single quote says "Ignore me, but display the rest of the data as-is; namely, don't ignore leading zeroes."

So you're correct that adding a second single quote after the "ignore me" single quote will keep the second one in there as part of the value that gets displayed.
Have then type ABCD, XYZW, 1BDI and then concatenate the apostrophes and then replace the spaces with nothing and finally replace the commas with ','
