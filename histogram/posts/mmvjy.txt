[xPost from r/funny]Made this for a girl who says she's too old for me.
You may be my hero.  I have made excel sheets for so many random things it's not even funny.
Was asked to repost this here, hope you guys enjoy!  Excel sheets is a huge portion of my job and I actually kind of enjoy it.  Didn't know this subreddit existed, so wassup???
