Just posted an Excel Video Lesson on advanced lookup techniques using Index & Match functions.  Thought you may find it useful!
awesome video and site!!
And I know what I'll be doing the rest of today.
I'm going to have to try look at this. Odd thing is, I consider myself a pretty advanced Excel user, but don't recall ever using the 'INDEX' function.
bookmarked!
