trying to see if part of a string in one cell is not found within another
I'm not on my computer right now but would the VBA function inStr not do what you need?
Where is this list of domains stored? Aside from that, here's how to check to see if an email's domain is listed in your array of domains.

    Option Explicit
    
    Public DomainList() As String
    
    Private Sub Example()
        Dim TempDomains As String
        
        TempDomains = "gmail.com;hotmail.com;live.com;yahoo.com;ymail.com;aol.com;"
        
        Call ExtractDomains(TempDomains, DomainList)
        MsgBox IsListed("Psyladine@gmail.com", DomainList)
    End Sub
    
    Private Sub ExtractDomains(ByVal RawString As String, ByRef arr() As String)
        DomainList = Split(RawString, ";")
    End Sub
    
    Private Function IsListed(ByVal EmailString As String, ByRef arr() As String) As Boolean
        Dim Counter As Long
        Dim Domain As String
        
        Domain = Right(EmailString, Len(EmailString) - InStr(1, EmailString, "@"))
        
        For Counter = 0 To UBound(arr)
            If InStr(1, arr(Counter), Domain) <> 0 Then
                IsListed = True
                Exit Function
            End If
        Next Counter
    End Function

Executing the `Example` sub will run the example code to verify that it does indeed work.

Also not near a computer, but if you loop through the list and use if ! inStr and add those values to an array it should work. 
Maybe, but it seems like that would just duplicate the function of ISNUMBER(SEARCH, seeing if the website was in the list.  Unless I could define within the array of mtokens to use instr against website...
the list of domains are stored in the contact's related entity organisation, under Website. Logic interprets them within the CRM system, but for the purposes of the report they just appear in a column after the organisation.

Your code would work if every organisation had the same group of domains, but it's dynamic, and there are 38,000 contacts in 1300 orgs each with its own unique array, some of which that are not valid domains (i.e. no contact uses them).

I'd thought this would be a straightforward process but it's looking very difficult to do a simple thing...

My code will work with whatever string of delimited domains is passed to it, which was why I was asking.

    ExtractDomains(ByVal RawString As String, ByRef arr() As String)

Will delimit and store all the domains passed to it within the array that is also passed to it. I just wasn't sure where your delimited string was located, so I defined the parameter identical to your existing code. The `Public DomainList() As String` array is referenced because it will always be available for you to store a specific array of domains as determined by what is passed to `ExtractDomains`

    IsListed(ByVal EmailString As String, ByRef arr() As String) As Boolean

Will always simply check to see if a given contact email's domain is stored within the passed array. As long as you extract that contact's list of domains immediately prior to checking to see if the email's domain is listed, then you will receive accurate information.
