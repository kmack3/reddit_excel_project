Office 365 Developer Program with one year free Office 365
I marked this as an advertisement because it seemed the best fit.

I don't have any more information and haven't signed up myself. Hopefully it will still be available when I have some free time.
I am not a fan of the ongoing charge model that everyone seems to be going towards.

Best of all, they are being *real* coy about the cost of the "Developer Account"... you have to provide your info, make an account, THEN you get to "review order"
Thank you for sharing. I'll be sure to pass this onto people I know.
Please can you provide any more details on the cost?

I was sent the info in the post by a friend. Just tried clicking through and got to the sign up page, which I don't want to go through right now.

The following tentative information is from http://www.hotukdeals.com/freebies/free-office-365-developer-account-25-users-x-5-installs-1-year-2543907:

*You can sign up for a Microsoft Office 365 developer account free for 1 year, which gives you access to full Microsoft Office (including app downloads) for up to 25 users, with 5 app installs per user, Skype for Business, Sharepoint and Exchange email.*

*Obviously if you want to continue after a year there is a cost (Â£5.10 per user per month)*
