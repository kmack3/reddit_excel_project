Setting A Default Cell Category
One trick is to open the CSV in the notepad app of your choice, copy, and paste into Excel. Don't open the CSV directly into Excel. 

The Excel file can be formatted ahead of time (e.g., with certain columns as text) to preserve those columns with leading zeros.
I created a CSV inport macro for just this occasion.. it allows once off datatype input at import, or you can open with a data type definition file each time...
