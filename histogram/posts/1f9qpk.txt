I just found out about Excel Interactive Tables online. The info provided by MS wasn't very helpful, so I made this quick tutorial. What do you guys think?
This is amazing. Thanks!
I am continually getting an error "We're sorry. We're having trouble preparing the data right now"

Not sure if this is a problem in IE8 (at work, no other browsers to test with) or if it relates to some sort of server issue? 
OK, I am often a Microsoft critic

I do like Excel

But these simple lines of code look to take it to a whole new level!

That's actually really, really cool

Thanks for sharing this - I'd never even heard anything of it

This 1 post alone has made my subscription to Reddit worthwhile! :)
Awsome!
This looks great. Thanks!
That's pretty damn cool. I don't know where I would use it yet or host it or how it would work out - but its pretty damn cool.
This is great, but there doesn't seem to be any options for configuring the standard charts in the interactive web page. Any help here?
Wow, even worked on an old version of 2007 at home. Thanks for writing this up I didn't even know this existed.

I said the exact same thing, out loud!
Is there a warning popup that appears at the bottom of the page? There was for me in IE and clicking ok or whatever in that box fixed it. 
Wow, thanks, I'm glad I could help!
Honestly, I couldn't find anything either.  It looks like it predicts the best kind of chart given the data.  I'm guessing you would have to actually host this on a sharepoint server for any customization...
I think it's that the work proxy blocks imgur, actually

I'll try again at home

Thanks for the suggestion :)
I would love to be able to use a PivotTable report in an Interactive Excel web page like this. Does anyone know the most straightforward way to accomplish this?
