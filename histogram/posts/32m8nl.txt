Is there a way to import stats from sites like mlb.com or baseball-reference to excel without copy & pasting everything manually?
Another suggestion that no one has mentioned is utilizing a webquery. I dont know how those websites lay out stats, but that is what I use to download stats from PGA.com for fantasy golf. you simply input the URL of the site you are getting data from and if it is a static URL then you can easily refresh the queries every time you open the workbook without having to recopy and past or click and drag or anything like that. 


just click Data > Get External Data > From web 
and follow the prompts. More info can be found here https://support.office.com/en-nz/article/Get-external-data-from-a-Web-page-708f2249-9569-4ff9-a8a4-7ee5f1b1cfba
In addition to B-Ref, the FanGraphs Leaderboards have a ton of functionality and an Export button that downloads a CSV. You can customize what data is shown, filter by date, aggregate at the team level, and much more. 

http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=8&season=2015&month=0&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0

I use both B-Ref and FanGraphs for about 90% of my baseball research, and mostly FanGraphs. (The Play Index at B-Ref is really good for tricky and unusual data questions, but not more typical inquiries.)
you can try import.io
Yes it is possible ... i do the same with soccer results. it fetches the data from a certain website an edits it to outputs it in the correct format to keep my subreddit up to date (/r/austriansports if anyone is interested). if you want i could post the file or the code (allthough its a written clusterfuck since i wrote that sometimes in the night and was too tired to clean it up - well never change a running system i guess)
Yes. Check [this](http://www.mrkent.com/tools/converter/) out. There are probably better tutorials out there, just google "Excel web table import".
On Baseball reference (or any of the sports reference sites) there is a link that says "[export](http://imgur.com/yIabayJ)" above the table.  Clicking this will download an excel file with the data in it.

Alternatively, next to the export button there is a "CSV" button.  I prefer to use it.  It will make the data look like [this](http://imgur.com/5bDGCMP), which is very easy to copy and paste into excel.  Then its just a few clicks* using the text to columns feature to create a nice table that you have more control over.  This method also has the advantage of not requiring you to download a new file every time you want a new table, you can copy and paste them all into a single excel file.  

Instructions for text to columns*

1. Go to "data"--->"text to columns"
2. Make sure delimited is selected, click next
3. Make sure comas is selected, click finish
Awesome, Thank you!
Thanks!
Thank you!
You can rearrange and add/remove columns before exporting too. It's pretty darn slick. 
Perfect, Thank you!
