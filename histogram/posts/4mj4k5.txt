Noob Question, Very simple, but can't figure it out.
In cell F26: 

    =sum(F2:F25)

In cell G26:

    =sum(G2:G25)

The formula tab has the "autosum" function, it's pretty intuitive.  It might have even suggested this for you.  

EDIT: Format
Into G26, type in:

    =SUM(G2:G25)

And repeat the same for F26, but replace the G's with F's.
You weren't wrong in your title :-P
And a shortcut for this in future is to click on the cell you want the sum to appear in, then press ALT and +.
