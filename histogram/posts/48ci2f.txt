Please excuse the spam...
I actually haven't seen any from /r/excel .  Lots of other subs.  but not this one.

Thanks for the hard work.

Thanks for the effort you are putting into it.
good work mods :)
>We have put a few "remove" rules in place

Did you set the AutoMod rule `action: remove `, or to `action: filter`?

If you use the filter action, AutoMod will remove the post but it will also go into your ModQueue so you can verify that anything removed is actual spam. 

And, from what other mods in /r/modclub and /r/modsupport have reported, setting the rule criteria for account age as low as to `< 6 hours` (and no karma threshold) has been enough to catch all of the waves of spambots that Reddit is being hit with, lately. 

(Some other mods have set theirs as high as 1 week, but that seems a bit excessive; I've gone with `< 1 days` and haven't yet had any false positives get caught by it, yet.)
/u/seo_nuke has been a handy no-effort solution for us, or alternatively setting automod to remove posts from accounts newer than 1 day and any posts reported more than once.
I echo u/SalAtWork -- this sub seems spam-free to me. Must be your anti-spam is working well. Good job on that!
Saw that one last night. I figured there was more. Crazy spam bots.
No problem
Thanks!  The porn spam hitting Reddit has been bad lately.  I've shut off all thumb nails because of it.  
Thank you for your hard work. I know it takes a lot of work to keep these subteddits clean and clear of garbage.

We've had around 90 spam posts in about 6 hours. 
action: spam

We can't use account age rule as it captures genuine posters (a lot of people are one-time posters).
You just unfortunately run the risk of deleting posts from legitimate users who may have come to /r/excel and can't get help until their post is fished out. 
The less than 1 day rule doesn't work well for us because it captures legitimate posters.

Did manage to find another trend to capture spam posts, and it worked well as far as I can see!
Yeah, it was brutal yesterday.  Today things have looked much much better though.  Again, thanks to the mods for the hard work.

Well, if you're ***at all*** worried of any non-spam users getting caught in your rules--which I gathered from your post is something you think could happen--then you should definitely change the AutoModerator rules from `action: spam` to `action: filter`.

Anything that matches the rule's criteria will be removed--just as it is, now--but then it also puts the post into the modqueue so one of the mods can verify that it's actual spam. 

If it isn't spam, then you can just re-approve the post and everyone can see it on the sub, again. 

And, If it is spam, then just press the spam button to confirm that it's spam and then it's cleared from the modqueue. 

It's really the best way to ensure you aren't catching real users as false-positives by AutoModerator--and, if you ***do***, you can correct it very quickly so it has minimal impact on the user/post.


(Also, you can go to your reddit account preferences page, go to the RSS tab, and then copy the RSS feed link for "Modqueue" and use something the IFTTT app to notify you when there is a new post in the modqueue.)


You can always set it to leave a note asking them to PM the mods. There are a lot of solutions available which are better than just waiting for a human to report it.
We manually review too but 99% of the posts were either spam or broke some other rule so it's no loss.
Filter it is.

Gracias.
No problem. 

I have noticed that the AutoModerator filter action is a drastically unknown and underused functionality for a lot of subs, so I try to help spread the word. :)
