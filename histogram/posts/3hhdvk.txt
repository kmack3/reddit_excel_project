Create an Actual vs Goal chart in Excel 2013 in less than 60 seconds
Very nice application. It's a simplification of the [Bullet Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_graph), which can be achieved by using a stacked chart for the Goal series axis.
Thanks, this might spice up my departmental expense report! 
This is nice, never seen these before. Do the shaded areas within each chart have a specific meaning? And the line?
yes, but the specific meaning is up to the organization. Perhaps it would be 50% of goal, 75% of goal, 100% of goal. Perhaps it would be Cost of Goods, Total Cost, Financial Goal.
