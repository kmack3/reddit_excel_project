Least helpful trend chart...ever.
Result of Analysis: Your shit's all fucked up.
Looks to me like you are not active on weekends.  My recommendation would be to line your data up in a way that each month starts on the first business day of the month and just cut the weekends out.  See how that looks.
God this is awful. My OCD is taking over *must...graph...something...ahhhh*
might i also suggest you also line up the data by day...eg are all your mondays super busy compared to wednesdays kind of thing.

also looks like you're using Tableau....i miss it :(
Definitely Cyclical.
pivot dat shit
I don't get it, this looks just like all my data
I actually like it.
I'll say; there's no labels!
I think I've actually recreated the wave pattern for every dubstep song...
I know, I know.  This was just my first attempt at trending out some monthly data and I thought it was the crappiest thing I'd seen in quite some time.
Naw, just vanilla 2010.  Yes, I realized I needed to match up the days of the week after loading the data for the first time...it just made me laugh how crappy it looked to begin with.
Or the KPI of your migraine headaches...
Ah yeah.  I just recognized it because I did the same exact thing some time ago.  You graph it thinking you'll get something useful.  Low and behold it's absolute garbage... hooray!
