Excel checks value; if negative excel ignores it and sums only positive values
Here you go:
    
    =SUMIF(A:A,">0")
There's also:  

    =sum(max(A:A,0))  
Entered as an array formula.  Consider that solution as a learning opportunity. /u/speqter's solution is the better one.
May not be the most efficient way but you could create a column next to the one you want to have the values checked for. Let's say column B

B2 formula:  If(a2<0,0,A2)

Then have a cell add up all of those values and hide the column. 
> =SUMIF(A:A,">0")
Thx don`t know why i could not think of that :D







SOLUTION VERIFIED
Why are there quotes?

I thought quotes were only for text values.
It`s a database. I can`t really make other columns =/ Sadly it should be one-cell formula- if possible 
Thanks for response

You have awarded one point to _speqter_.

They are needed for sumif. If you wanted it to reference a cell it should be ">"&A1. 
Thanks!
