Initial thought: Why not just show people how to click and drag values down, up, sideways using the little square in the lower right of the cell? I get it's a keyboard shortcut course, but in your way you still have to use the mouse AND the shortcut is limited to down and right, rather than any direction when just using the first mouse click.
