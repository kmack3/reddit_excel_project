Is it possible to restrict edits to a worksheet depending on the time of day?
Here's what you could do:

Have a macro that runs when the workbook opens and checks the time, and if it's outside the allowed time, it locks the sheet2 with a password. You could also use a timer to call it to unlock/lock later (so if you open it at 07:00, it unlocks itself at 8:00 and if you open at 11:00, it relocks itself at noon). Or instead of a timer, you could have it check and lock/unlock everytime you switch worksheets.

To be semi-secure, you would need to password protect the VBA project too.
A lot of up-votes with no answers... hold in in there
Private Sub Workbook_Open()  
Application.OnTime TimeValue("17:00:00"), "Protectsheets"   
End Sub  

Sub Protectsheets()  
  Sheets("Sheet1").Protect Password:="Password"  
  Sheets("Sheet3").Protect Password:="Password"  
End Sub

EDIT: [Better way](http://www.cpearson.com/excel/workbooktimebomb.aspx)
And it would need to fetch the time from the internet, not from a local computer.
Lock the sheet with s password by default and have the macro unlock it. You can always disable macros to get around the lock if it's set unlocked by default. 
I'll give this a go, thanks :)
