How can I do, FirstName LastName to X.LastName@domain.com
    =LEFT(A1,1) & "." & RIGHT(A1, LEN(A1) - SEARCH(" ",A1)) & "@domain.com"

This is assuming that the name is in A1 and there is 1 space between first and last name.
=Concatenate(substitute(trim(A1)," ","."),"@domain.com")  
  
Where the name is in A1. 

Here's what it does: 
Trim(a1)  
Removes leading and lagged spaces. Always a risk with name lists.  
  
Substitute(Text," ",".")  
Turns the spaces between the words into periods.  
  
Concatenate(Text, "@domain.com")  
Appends @domain.com onto the name.  
  
So: 
Wozz Sta  
will become  
Wozz.Sta@domain.com  

Name | domain | result | 
:--- | :--- | :--- | 
A Smith | yahoo.com | =SUBSTITUTE(A2," ",".")&"@"&B2 | 
A Smith | yahoo.com | A.Smith@yahoo.com | 

Is there a space between first/last names, and is that the format throughout?

Worked perfectly thanks so much
Yeah there is a space and yes that is the format throughout. 
Not sure if it was clear in my OP, but each users full name is in a different cell, but each full name is in 1 cell. 

Hope that makes sense
