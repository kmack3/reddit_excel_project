I want to upvote this a thousand times
How is this not on the front page?
This is absolutely incredible.

You, sir, are a true Excel jockey.
I find what's most impressive is the limited amount of code - it's primarily driven by formula, a chart, and conditional formatting.  Good stuff!
Reminds me of playing Wizardry in the 80's
Wow.  I coded minesweeper and solitaire in excel years ago, but I had no idea something this grand was possible.
Master!! please share with us your wisdom!
I went around the outside.  That was fun.
I think it's awesome and upvoted for sure.

However none of the buttons work.  I get an error that just says 400 :(

I hope I can resolve this error before attempting to learn it myself.
...not much a maze when you have a map...

This is incredible though.
Where can I download more of these?
It is on the front page provided that you only subscribe to /r/excel :)
That's how I role!
Mahalito!
I'm sorry to hear that. Let's see if we can troubleshoot this. Is the error happening in the download file above - or in the file on Cary's blog? Have you attempted to run the maze program as the only Excel file open? Are you running the file from on a shared/network/cloud drive? What version of Excel are you using?
I recently made another game, you can download it and the source code here: http://carywalkin.ca/2014/01/29/candy-number-crunch-saga-released/

If you're interested in the tutorials. You can see the rest of the VBA4Play tutorial series here: http://carywalkin.ca/category/vba4play/
Sorry. Meant /r/bestof
I used the file linked above.  Downloaded directly to my pc.

Enabled macro's and every button I press an error box pops up.  It says nothing but the number 400.  Not error 400, just 400 lol.

I tried running it clean on a fresh restart with no wins

Try running it with you add-ins disabled. My guess is that a sheet name or variable within my workbook overlaps with that of one your add-ins. 
Just tried it again with all of my add ins disabled and it still occurs.

damn
Did you disable them...including the XY labeler...leave Excel and come back in? Sorry if that seems like a dumb question, but I was so hopeful that was the problem. 
Lol yeh.  disabled... closed excel... restarted computer... tried again... No good :(
