Pivot Table Add Filter VBA
Not enough info to help and your explanation is not clear. Why replicate a PT with filters? You could use filtering to validate results shown by a pivot table, but you would need to use a SUBTOTAL function to get some results.
I have a combo box drop down.  The drop down displays the pivot table setup along with which filters the table has.  So for example, "Pivot Table 1" Has a Date Column and a Rep row, while "Pivot Table 2" has a Rep Column and a Date row.  I'm trying to do the same for filters right now!
