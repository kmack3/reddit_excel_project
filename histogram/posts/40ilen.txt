Hiding sheet macro
Try this

    Sub HideSheets()
    
        Dim ws As Worksheet
    
        For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets

            If ws.Name = "Summary" then Goto NextSheet            

            'CHECKS SHEET1, COLUMN A (1)
            If Sheets("Summary").Columns(1).Find(ws.Name) Is Nothing Then
                
                'HIDE SHEET IF NOT FOUND IN THAT LIST
                ws.Visible = xlSheetHidden
            
            End If
        
    NextSheet:
        Next
    
    
    End Sub

    Sub User53881()
    
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastrow As Long
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim j As Integer
    
    Set ws = ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet
    ws.Range("A1").Activate
    lastrow = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    For j = 1 To lastrow
        For i = Worksheets.Count To 1 Step -1
            If Worksheets(i).Name = ws.Cells(j, 1) Then
                Worksheets(i).Visible = xlSheetHidden
            End If
        Next
    Next
        
    End Sub

Slick. Much cleaner than what I was about to post. 
error 9, subscript out of range :\

debug =        If Sheets("Sheet1").Columns(1).Find(ws.Name) Is Nothing Then
Friendly comment, this will also hide Sheet1, or whichever sheet has the list of sheets unless OP included that in the list (which I wouldn't do because it would probably be named something like Summary or Master).
After changing "sheet1" to "summary" this wound up giving me an error and hid everything :[ .  Even my macro to "unhide all" is failing.  I had to exit and reload the file.
Hey, you helped me make this a few months ago and it just started failing. Any idea why I get a "run time error "1004" 

method 'visible' of object '_worksheet' failed"? I haven't changed the code at all...
Didn't work...but it didn't give me any errors..... D: ??
Cheers. Let's see yours?

Works fine for me, do you have a sheet called Sheet1?
Do you perhaps not have a "Sheet1" in your workbook?
I'm not sure what you're doing wrong - it works without any problem for me.
Which line does it break on? Hit debug.
    Sub User53881()
    
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim lastrow As Long
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim j As Integer
    
    Set ws = ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet
    ws.Range("A1").Activate
    lastrow = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    For j = 1 To lastrow
        For i = Worksheets.Count To 1 Step -1
            If Worksheets(i).Name = ws.Cells(j, 1) Then
                Worksheets(i).Tab.Color = rgbRed
            End If
        Next
    Next
    
    For Each ws In Application.Worksheets
        If ws.Tab.Color <> red Then
            ws.Visible = xlSheetHidden
        End If
    Next
    
    For Each ws In Application.Worksheets
        With ws.Tab
            .Color = xlNone
        End With
    Next
    
    End Sub

It's embarrassingly clunky in comparison but....

    Sub hide_sheets()
    
        Dim oWS As Worksheet
        
        For Each oWS In Worksheets
            If oWS.Index <> Sheets(1).Index Then oWS.Visible = xlSheetHidden
        Next oWS
        
        On Error Resume Next
        For Each cell In Sheets(1).Range("A8:A" & Sheets(1).UsedRange.Rows.Count)
            Sheets(cell.Value).Visible = True
        Next cell
        On Error GoTo 0
        
    End Sub

or, I posted a different way to do it in this thread that might not encounter this error.

Good Luck!
No I don't have a sheet named sheet1.  The active sheet that I'm doing this in is called "Summary" and as per Fuzzius' point, I would like to NOT hide this sheet.
It was protected...somehow.  It's fixed!  Thanks!
In the code, change where it says "Sheet1" to "Summary" and make sure you add the Summary sheet to the same column!
So I don't want to add Summary to the column...this sheet is kind of blank.  It gets populated by a macro that refers to a list (employees).  So it gets filled up with names/sheets (column a) and their corresponding hours worked (column b, c, d, etc).  There's a macro that removes rows (employees) who have 0 hours worked for that time period.  So bam, what's left are employees who have actively worked for that time period.  I want this macro to simply check column A and hide every sheet that is not listed there.

If this macro were for me then I would say it's not a big deal for me to type in summary in column a everytime and then hit the macro.  But the person who is using this is (shockingly) worse at excel than I am.  HA
Not in the column, in the VBA code.

On Line 8, change Sheets("Sheet1") to Sheets("Summary")

Edit: Sheet is one of those words that starts to look really weird after you type it a few times...
I've edited the original code for you so it doesn't hide the Summary sheet, and it's already linked to it. Try it out.
