/r/Excel, do you have a favorite keyboard shortcut?
[deleted]
CTRL+PAGE UP and  CTRL+PAGE DOWN for switching between worksheets.

Also my [master workbook](http://excelexposure.com/workbook/) has a full listing of Excel shortcuts marked with my favorites :)
Depends what you're doing but here are a few I use a lot now that I've got used to them. They're quite obscure. 

Alt+H+V+V = Paste values only
Alt+H+S+C = Clear filters without turning filters off
Ctrl+Shift+L = Apply filters to top row
the best one i've encounted ctrl + [   if you have a cell referring to another cell, it will take you to that.  If you want to go back hit f5 and enter

Such a time saver
One I didn't see is Ctrl ~ which displays all the formulas.
Ctrl + Alt +V : Paste special. (I know people have listed other ways, but that is my favourite.

Ctrl + 1 : Format

F4: Repeat last action
Windows-

* F12 = Save As
* CTRL+Spacebar = Select Column
* SHIFT+Spacebar = Select Row
* F4 = Toggle between $ and non-$ versions of a reference

Also, not a keyboard shortcut, but double-clicking Format Painter locks it in until you cancel it, instead of turning off after one paint.
ctrl+1 = Format Cells
*Ctrl+shift+-*

Removes borders from the selected cells.
Alt h f i s to fill down a series of numbers. Useful every time you need to number your rows
F2 to edit cell.
F4 - repeats action applied on previously selected cell to a currently selected cell. Works in most MS Office products.
Alt+D+P opens up the PivotTable and PivotChart Wizard so you can create consolidated PivotTables

Alt+E+A+A deletes everything (including formating)

Alt+H+L+R opens up the Conditional Formatting Rules Manager

Ctrl+Shift+1 number format

Ctrl+Shift+ 4 currency format

Ctrl+Shift+5 percentage format

When highlighting a formula or equation within editing, pressing F9 gets the result of the formula or the equation (therefore inspecting is much easier)
You've got your basics which are always helpful since they're used so often:

* CTRL + B: Bold
* CTRL + I: Italicize
* CTRL + C: Copy
* CTRL + V: Paste
* CTRL + X: Cut
* CTRL + Z: Undo

Some other favorites (the ones that really save some time) are a little more unique, but very helpful:

* CTRL + Arrow Key: Goes to the last item before a blank cell in any direction
* CTRL + SHIFT + Arrow Key: Does the same thing as above, just highlights everything along the way
* ALT + =: Inserts the autosum funtion
* CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER: Makes whatever function is in that cell an array function which is quite powerful. (Still learning the ins and outs of that one)
* CTRL + F3: Brings up a dialogue that has all of your named ranges and tables, allowing editing and pasting of the list
ALT-D-F-S and ALT-E-S.  Alt DFS resets the filter and Alt ES is for pasting special.  I usually find myself using both almost everytime I'm in Excel.
Ctrl + T 

Makes a table. 
Alt FDA--send current file as email

ALT dfs--remove filters

ALT hef--remove formatting

ALT am--remove duplicates

ALT ass--sort
My newest favorite is Ctrl+H for Find & Replace. 
Ctrl-.  Activates different corners of current selection
I made some of my own:

Ctrl + Q - removes any interior color

Ctrl + M - adds a random interior color

Ctrl + E - Pastes any copied range/text as values


As for the default ones:


I'd add Ctrl + D - copies the contents of the topmost cell into the rest of the range (within the same column)
Alt+H+O+W - Adjusts the width of a selected column without having to right click and find the option in the list.  

Alt+H+O+H is for row height.
F2 to switch between edit mode and enter mode. It lets you move the cursor with the arrow keys when inside a formula. 
Select any part of your table, press Ctrl+Shft+8 and it selects the whole table
Ctrl + S - depending on how reliable your computer is you'll want to do this every time you make any kind of progress.
Ctrl + PgUp or PgDn to cycle through sheets.

Pretty much everything else I use has been covered, surprised no one mentioned save though... that should be the first thing taught to anyone who uses a computer. 
Control shift over then control shift down to highlight everything quickly 
When in a pivot table, instead of changing the values in the dialogue box, right click then press m then press s for sum.
I use Macabacus Lite plugin and the Ctr+Shift+C will center whatever you have in the selected cell across your selected array. This soooo much easier that hitting Ctr+1 to open the cell formatting. Use this once and you'll never merge another group of cells together again.
For updating dates in workbooks in mass, I like CTRL + ;

ALT E+S+V  for paste special values ! 
CTRL + * selects an entire table. So if you have two tables (say A1:C5 and F1:H5), clicking within one of the tables and hitting CTRL + * will select the appropriate table.

ALT + = at the end of a column or row takes the sum of the column/row.

Hitting ENTER automatically moves the cursor down a cell. SHIFT + ENTER up, TAB right, SHIFT + TAB left, and CTRL + ENTER keeps the active cell selected. CTRL + ENTER can also be used to populate a selection of cells (e.g., select A1:A5, type a value or formula, and then hit CTRL+ENTER to populate all cells with the same value/formula).

SHIFT + F11 to create a new worksheet.
Ctrl+;  today's date
I love ctrl+page up and ctrl+page down to move between sheets. There's also ALT + JP+V+C to crop pictures xD
I made a structured 45 minute video lesson designed to help people quickly learn Excel keyboard shortcuts that are relevant to them, and to master shortcuts in general. It took me months. Check it out:

http://excelfinancialmodelling.com/resources/shortcuts

Everything on the website is free to access without registering.


Ctrl+Shift+5 to format your numbers to %.
CTRL +Shift +End  [Select across + down all].

CTRL +T              [Make a table]


If you select a table column's data, you can use Goto Special to do things like remove the blanks:

{

CTRL +G     [Go to...]

alt +S        [Special] 

Y               [Visible cells only]

K               [Blanks] 

}

This helps for collecting or cleaning data.

If you want to make the cursor go Down/Right: 

2007:

ALT +F +I +A +Tab +D/R +Enter 

2013:

ALT +F +T +A +Tab +D/R +Enter

Alt +F11 to open VBA

Shift +F11 New Sheet

ALT +O +H +R Rename Sheet

ALT +R +P +S Sheet Protection

F12 Save As

ALT D F F or ALT A T to AutoFilter

ALT AGG/AUU Group/Ungroup 

Alt P R S  Set Print Area.

CTRL Shift +V Paste Special...
The Mouse wheel will cycle through the ribbon menus if you mouse over the ribbon.

Not really a keyboard shortcut, but ever since I learned this I don't use them as much anymore. 
F4 for everything.
Ctrl+Left or Right cursor moves across text, by whole words.
Shift+Left or Right single character selection
Shift + Ctrl + Home  Select text between the cursor and the beginning of the document
Ctrl + Arrow Key.  'nuff said.
F5. 
Alt + F4.

Try it, you'll thank me.
This is key for macros too. I dislike hotkeys for complex macros because they can really jack up your data. Use a button.
Good call!!
This is amazing. Thanks!
I don't know how many times I've hit alt-tab trying (but failing) to switch between sheets
THANK YOU
Ah awesome. I was actually planning on checking out Excel Exposure haha.
> ALT+H+V+V = Paste values only

I love you.
Alt+E+S+V will also paste values (what I learned to use)
Right Click -> S -> V is also a shortcut to paste values, plus you can target your destination when you right click the cell. You can do this for other "Paste Special" options, for example Right Click -> S -> T is paste formats, S W is paste column widths, etc.
Alt + H+V+E is a slight variation, it pastes values but keeps formatting (so if you're pasting from a formula that is formatted as $ it keeps the dollars, shading, borders etc.)
You know ctrl+alt+v does the same thing? 
I use Alt+H+S+C all day long. 
You can also paste value by doing CTRL + V, CTRL then V while not holding CTRL. This is the drop down menu shortcut to paste value. I find it faster this way

I like that and didn't know it.  Thanks.
Well I'll be double dipped I'm shit. Learn something new every day. Thanks!
You can also set excel so that when you doubleclic that value it brings you to the refering cell
Deserves to be higher up, CTRL+~ is a lifesaver for complicated workbooks.
I like this. I did have to play around a bit to figure out how it works. For anyone else having trouble:

You must have a starting value in your cell. If you do not specify a stop value, you have to select the entire range which you want numbered.
No CRTL + S?  You don't save a lot?
no Ctrl+D? I discovered it by mistake and I love it!
I love these! Thanks.
Ctrl+A will do this too
Since people seem to be loving paste values, one of the examples on the video for that is:

Menu, V

The Menu or Application key is between the right Ctrl and Windows keys. It accesses the context menu, which is commonly associated with the right mouse button. It's only reliably available on full size windows oriented keyboards. Shift+F10 also works.
Hmm what is the ribbon menu?
Same. It's like a reflex.
Great to hear you were planning on checking out the site! 

Another random shortcut I just remembered is if you have multiple cells selected and type something then hit CTRL+ENTER rather than just ENTER it puts it in all the cells selected.
If you CTRL+V to paste, and hit CTRL again, a contextual menu pop-up and you can just hit V again and it pastes values only.
I have to paste values all the time at work so I just made it into a macro and now it's my CTRL + Q, maybe that'll help as well.
This is what I use too.  Carryover from pre-Ribbon days.
And you can easily type that with the left hand after copying
This is my go to.  People are amazed when they see me click + s + v.
Wow. So many options for paste special / value I didn't know about.  This one seems like it may be the quickest.
For anyone wondering, Ctrl+D copies the cell above your active cell into the active cell.
That will grab the header row too though won't it? 
It depends on what version you have.  In 2007 the ribbon was introduced, it's just menu bar at the top. If you have 2010, it looks less like a ribbon and more a menu with tabs.  You can use the mouse wheel to flip between the menu tabs.
Did not know this! Awesome.
I feel better about the world after reading this...
I find this really dangerous because you can't undo macros.
Did the same, allocated it to CTRL+SHIFT+V
Good call, I always forget that you can have a hotkey for macros. I've been thinking about doing that for merge and center, too.
I put it in the shortcut bar at the top. 
This may be a dumb question. Does this only work for the excel books that you created this macro in? is there a way to keep the ctrl q short cut for all excel workbooks you use?
May I have the macro? You'd save me soooo many clicks.
I just went crazy with these, CRTL+SHIFT+V has saved me so much time, I have made one for, filter top row, saves as dialog, show custom sort dialog, and a delete macro, all bound to keys on the left hand side.
Yup, as long as you save the macro onto your Personal workbook, it should apply to all future sheets/books you use!
Macro recorder.
That's great to know. I'm still learning VBA.
