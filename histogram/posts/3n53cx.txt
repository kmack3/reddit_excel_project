I received a simple, but oh so rewarding compliment today.
You might want to Learn Access.

Boom! 
I certainly think Access would've been a good tool for this, but the bossman was pushing for Excel and it's more worthwhile for me to be an Excel wizard in this and future positions. 
Are there any suggested courses for Access? 
On a resume, *Database Management* is worth more than *Excel Wizard* by a good $30k per year.
At your next meeting mention the powers of access...this is what it's for and the reports that you can run are beneficial. 
I read a book called The Excel Analysts Guide to Access. That helped me a lot when I told my boss a few years ago "yes, I can build an Access database" when I had never opened the software before. Still employed and the database is still in use by two separate teams so I did something right. I never want to look at that one again though. Probably embarrassing how bad it is, but it works. 
Hmm... What happens if I use 'magician'? Or maybe 'guru'?
Bonus points on the resume if you list Hogwarts as your Excel Wizard school and state that you graduated Magnum Gryffindor.
You get a chuckle and a slap, respectively.
I dropped my monster wand that I use for my Magnum Gryffindor
