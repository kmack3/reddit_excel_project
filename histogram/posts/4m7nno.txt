[2013] Is there a way to hotkey the format painter?
Add it to your Quick Access Toolbar then press ALT+ position e.g. 1/2/3 etc

Really think it's a good idea to learn keyboard shortcuts for this. Alt+H+V+S+t
Do you know that you can double click the format painter to paste into multiple cells?
Can also do this with top border and side border to make charts much faster (mostly for financial modeling)
Not a perfect solution but I use F4 to redo a previous action. So use format painter one time then mash F4 a bunch of times. 
Many thanks! I've never really made use of that toolbar. Much appreciated.

Can confirm, this is the best way, I started doing it a month ago and it's much better than a personal macro with hotkey because that wipes your undo stack. I have values and formats set up as 1 and 2 (first two in bar).
Yes, I knew that, but that is not my normal routine. I typically do one-off format painting, plus I'm a hotkey fanatic. Thanks, though.
