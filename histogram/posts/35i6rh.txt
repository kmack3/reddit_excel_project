We asked. You answered. We listened.
And yes, we used PivotTables, slicers, formulas, data tables AND graphs to select our candidates.
I would just like to thank the mods for their vote of confidence.

/r/Excel is where I spend by far the most of my time on Reddit, and when not solving Excel issues on Reddit and learning more about Excel, I am looking for problems to solve with Excel at work where I do Test and Data analysis and reporting!!
I want to thank the mods for this new responsibility!

Since I'm a Flair Manager, does that mean I'm not a fascist? Or am I half fascist?

I'm confused.

Thanks to all the mods, old and new, for volunteering time to make this sub a helpful place!
But did you use Solver to ensure this was the optimal solution?

Congrats to the new mods!
I trust there was some conditional formatting too, to ensure that the best candidates were highlighted appropriately.  

Congrats and welcome to the new ~~mods~~ flair managers.
[You decide](http://www.quickmeme.com/img/79/79aa4e40bea96024462d26ef3343e9849d4923d0f680f3d25e2e62b0dba02f52.jpg).
Pivot? Solver? Pfffttt...just a simple ask to Clippy will automatically show those 3 user.

Hi!  It looks like you're looking for help with an Excel function!
Unfortunately I have not learned that function yet. If you'd like to
change that, [message the
moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fexcel)!
