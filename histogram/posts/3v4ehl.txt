I just want to move one row w/o the cut/insert.
Click the row number, then hold the cursor over the top or bottom of the black outline that appears. Then hold and drag.
I'll give that a try tonight, thanks!
No problem. Just make sure to post a reply at me with "Solution Verified" - it'll mark this thread as "solved" (and I'll get a *sweet, sweet* Fake Internet Point for helping you).
