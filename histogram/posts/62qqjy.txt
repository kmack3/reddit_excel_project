Interesting mathematical pattern!
pretty beautiful pattern 
How did you make this? Its amazing
Reddit made me do it

    =LOWER(ROMAN(599,4)&LEFT(ADDRESS(1,7509,4),3)&REPT(REPLACE(0=0,2,3,),2))
Wow, I didn't even know Excel could do that!
Cool!

That's actually really cool!
Impressive. Most impressive!
I saved this post because I was on my mobile at the time - just got around to trying it out myself... beautiful! Just beautiful. 
Wow... just as beautiful in Google Sheets. Spreadsheets can do amazing things.
Cool, but some of the steps won't work for everyone (they depend on certain system settings, but I don't want to spoil the effect by saying too much).
What's going on with the REPLACE function here? I don't understand what's going on...
0=0 evaluates to TRUE. The REPLACE function takes the 3 characters starting from the 2nd character of TRUE (which, handily, it first converts to a string "TRUE") and replaces it with nothing. Result: T.
