Excel standards and 'best practice' discussion (less VBA, more about spreadsheet layout)
Separate your data and presentation layers. 
Every sheet you make should be optimized for eventual automation and expandability. This will help you in general create more robust and connectable data sets. 
There are a bunch of standards / methods / approaches promoted in the financial modelling industry.

The rules that seem to me to be the most universally agreed are:

* Keep formulae consistent - e.g. if you have a column for each time period, then each row should only contain one formula and that formula should be copied across all the periodic columns.
* Format clearly - generally it should be obvious whether a cell is an input, calculation or an output, but at the very least it should be clear which cells are inputs and which are not.
* Label clearly - the meaning of each value in the workbook should be readily apparent.
* Keep formulae short - anyone proficient in Excel should be able to quickly understand any given formula. You can usually break a single complex formula into multiple simpler steps.

I'd encourage anyone who's interested in this sort of thing to join [/r/FinancialModelling](http://www.reddit.com/r/financialmodelling/), which I set up months ago and don't really know how to promote / grow.

The published approaches that I am aware of are (in alphabetical order):

* [Access Analytic](http://www.slideshare.net/jgrob3/financial-modelling-best-practices)
* [BPM](http://www.bestpracticemodelling.com/resources?page=/resources/standards)
* [FAST](http://www.fast-standard.org/the-standard/)
* [IBM (ex PwC)](http://www.eusprig.org/smbp.pdf)
* [ICAEW](http://www.icaew.com/~/media/Files/Technical/information-technology/excel-community/166-twenty-principles-for-good-spreadsheet-practice.pdf)
* Operis has an approach which I think (from marketing material) is documented in the book “Practical Financial Modelling” by Jonathan Swan
* [PwC](http://www.pwc.com.au/deals/assets/Appreciating-Value-13-Feb13.pdf) (pages 10 and 11)
* [SCILS](http://numeritas.co.uk/wp-content/content/downloads/2011/11/Principles_SCILS_01.pdf)
* SMART is normally available but doesn’t seem to be at the moment (Corality produced SMART and their website is being updated)
I recently rewrote(?) a workbook used at work so that data was on one sheet, pivots on another, and dashboard on a third. No changes to functionality, just that, and some embiggened fonts.

It's now much easier to read and interpret, and I am one step closer to being office god. 
This is a great one - common sense but definitely needs to be spelled out.
I actually posted this over at r/actuary as well ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2ielef/excel_standards_and_best_practice_discussion_less/.compact)). It slipped my mind that the finance industry would be big on this as well.

Thanks for sharing those links - will look through them in a bit.
That sounds like a very cromulent usage of excel.
This. It is SO beneficial for spreadsheets that are used by people other than yourself to separate data and presentation. There were several workbooks that a number of co-workers at my office were always messing up because they'd accidentally paste new data over a formula, or cut instead of copy from the sheet, etc. so I did this. Data goes on one worksheet, presentation of data is on another, fully locked down worksheet that nobody can change. Often I will also use a hidden "calculations" sheet on really complex workbooks where I can keep reference tables, dropdown lists, and complex calculations so that I can avoid making extremely long formulas. I can break things up into stages so it is easy to follow.
Thanks for sharing, I'm interested in the actuarial take too. Some of the links I shared are pretty long and detailed, and I've already spent and inordinate amount of time amongst it - happy to share ideas / punnets to any particular areas of interest.
I would always outline the borders of cells where data input was required. This made it easy for users to know where they needed to input data.

If there was a lot of data input, I would make a separate data input sheet and again would have outlined borders around the cells where the actual data would be entered.
