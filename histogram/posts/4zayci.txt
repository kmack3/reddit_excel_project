Article x-post from /r/Technology: 20% of Scientific papers on genes contain name Conversion errors caused by Excel.
hmmm... that comment... what happens when you wanna paste zip codes and of of them is 08033? I guess you would what paste as text to ensure it doesn't end up as 8033?
I really hate floating point numbers. Is there any reason to have that feature on by default?
Is there a way to actuall turn this off? aka "default paste as text"?
I think it's pretty frightening that 20% of published papers were produced by people who don't know how to use their spreadsheet software, and didn't do this type of error checking.
Yup, I ran into this problem at work with CUSIP numbers (unique identifiers for securities). I solved it by formatting the column they were going into as text and then pasting copying destination formatting. 

It's easy to avoid these kinds of errors if you know what you're doing with excel but a lot of people really don't.
=right("0000"&RC,5) or 9 if you're using cusips like the poster below.

What I can't stand are the non-blank, non-text, non-number cells I keep getting from client .xls files. What the hell are these things?!
Some people do prefer them, and I guess it's a compatibility thing at this point.

Still, I hate that we don't even have an option to set the default. I work with EANs every day and need to set formatting every time.
Yeah excel isn't great when you're dealing with "000xxxx" type id's and case sensitive id's (e.g. "abx004" and "abX004" are distinct)

You can text format it but then you run the risk of it screwing up when pasting it in a new sheet or screwing up the formatting of an existing sheet when you paste format

If you really want to go hardcore 100% fool proof just add extra columns and convert the id into the individual Char() codes
There are a few operations where the conversion must be undone after import. I run into them infrequently, so I never remember what they are specifically.
Same for stock tickers
