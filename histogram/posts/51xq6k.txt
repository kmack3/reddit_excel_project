ELI5: How the HECK did Excel just do that?
FlashFill

The problem with data filled by some "magical tool" is that usually it is a nice start, but you still need to manually check it anyway.
Haha I would have loved to see your face when excel filled your range automatically ! It's like Excel reads minds sometimes :p Anyway I think it was "Flashfill"
ELI5: Magic.
More recent versions of Excel has a feature called "autocomplete" or "autofill" which let's Excel do this. [More technobabble here,](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Fill-data-automatically-in-worksheet-cells-74e31bdd-d993-45da-aa82-35a236c5b5db?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US&fromAR=1) though only the first few paragraphs are meaningful to your situation. When it works, it works, when it doesn't... headaches.

Excel is by no means interpreting your string or whatever you have in the table. It's matching actual data values that already exist.
Shave off more time by making a "language" master key and vlookup from that
Same thing happened to me today for the first time (just started using Office 2016).

Was about to look up a formula to remove 'x' number of characters from the string, but Excel just figured it out and filled in the entire column instead. Made my afternoon.
So that's what this is. Excel is amazing.
/u/pardon_the_mess if you could reply with the phrase "solution verified" to the answer you feel is the best, that would be handy. 
Solution verified
This is the correct response. Never trust fast-fill. 

I'd make sure there isn't any misalignment - especially since you're consolidating from various sources. 

Copy the two columns, paste off to the side, & remove duplicates.. If you do have anything off, just make the corrections off to the side and then Vlookup the corrected list back into the original. 
Completely agree. It may work correctly  90% of the time but the risk of failing 10% of the time, substantiates the need to check every time. 
Seriously, it may not be perfect, but it does seem magical every once in a while. The first time it happened was pretty awe inspiring.

Need to remove x characters from the right side:

     =LEFT(A1, LEN(A1)-x)

Need to remove x characters from the left side:

     =RIGHT(A1, LEN(A1)-x)

Yup. Whenever I hear so-and-so will run a script to automagically match the things, it means they'll spend 20 minutes getting it wrong and I'll spend a week making it usable.
