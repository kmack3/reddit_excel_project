Microsoft Excel Product Team AMA November 17th @ 12-1 PM EST.
But... cells are rectange.
Mr Clippy for president.
Will this AMA be in this subreddit? Or elsewhere? Also, will we be formulating questions to ask here? Or will a subsequent thread be posted?
Is it the good team or the MacOS B-squad? :)

Seriously though, I'm shocked how much faster Excel for windows runs inside a virtual machine on my mac than Excel for MacOS running natively right next to it.
Negative column number in VLOOKUP please. 
I'm gonna forget about this AMA, but damn it, when will we get auto resize of merged cells? 
why oh why does the find and replace dialogue box place the focus on the replace with control instead of the find control as does Word?  Why are they different?  Experienced user and I get trapped by that all the time because I use Word and Excel. And you guys are always harmonizing to our detriment. Do you think you could harmonize for the better for a change?  and Find and replace -> options -> values -> find all - User has to expand the listing to see anything.  Can't you put a line of code in their to expand so you can see some freaking results?  Does anyone at MS use Excel?
For the love of all that is good can we please incorporate a Python IDE into Excel?
A few years back, the MS HPC team developed a solution for parallel / distributed Excel worksheet recalc on a cluster of local servers. What would it take to get you to turn this into an on demand service hosted in the cloud for your hundreds of thousands of power users?

Office 2016 includes Excel 2016 which includes PowerPivot? Office365 Home is sold as fully installed Office 2016 applications. Why then does Excel, as supplied with O365 Home, not include PowerPivot. When do you plan on rectifying this error and include PowerPivot in Excel with O365 Home?

Why has the UserVoice topic requesting this, now on page one of top Excel.UserVoice suggestions currently with 145 unique votes not been responded to by your [XL TM] yet some topics with less than 5votes have been responded to?
      https://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304921-excel-for-windows-desktop-application/suggestions/9018823-make-the-power-bi-family-powerpivot-powerquery

Why do your product pages mislead people into the understanding that O365 Home will include PowerPivot by stating that it includes fully installed versions of Office2016?
      https://products.office.com/en-gb/office-365-home#

Why does your 'What's the difference between Office 365 and Office 2016?' page not mention the lack of PowerPivot in Office365 Home??

The #ExcelChampMY contest is a cheat and rigged in favour of one contestant. I believe the people in Microsoft Malaysia who are in charge of this contest are responsible for this. So underhanded. I never expected the organisers to stoop so low and organise a rigged contest. Not a level playing field at all. I managed to get 2nd highest marks in the Quarter Finals and I wasn't invited to participate in the Semi Finals and those who scored lower than me did. The organisers were not transparent at all. Instead of doing the contest virtually like all other countries they decided to invite their choice of finalists to Microsoft Malaysia's own office for the Semi Finals. They also did not even announce the finalists on the contest website but instead did it 'silently' on Facebook to prevent unwanted backlash. This will not work. Complaints will be lodged to the CEO of Microsoft.

Having to make the decision between 32bit vs 64bit is a HUGE roadblock to convincing people that you can use Excel for medium sized data and that using the DataModel/DAX is a big productivity gain.   Using 32bit excel, you run into memory errors that to the uninformed user make like the product is shit.  In (some/many/most?) corporate environments  only 32bit is provided because it removes the complexity of people having to deal with the decision of picking 32bit/64bit add-ins.   

So the question is, can you/will you/when will you get rid of 32bit Office and have only 64bit office which plays well with 32bit add-ins?

Cross sheet criteria references and sorting changes reference lookup: For example, if you do a SUMIFS where the sum column and the criteria ranges are on a different worksheet (same workbook) but the criteria is on the current worksheet. Then sort the whole table at the end, the reference go out of alignment. To avoid it you need to remove the worksheet name from the criteria before you sort. Can a fix be done for this? I spot it a lot on co-workers sheets, most people check the formula before the sort as they don't expect a sort to change a formula.
Since I do not know this: is there a way to mass change "count" into "sums" in Excel 2016? Basically I want to ask them if they could add this functionality somewhere (maybe as an option?), but I do not know if they havent added it to Excel 2016 already.

edit: 2. No "refresh pivot table" option on android.
Why are tables slow to sort, convert text to values, add/remove rows/columns etc.? Often it also causes Excel to crash when using more than 100,000 rows
FTLOG Please just make default format in pivots number format!

Is there a plan to implement JavaScript or Python or C# for MACROS?
Ability to use F4 (repeat last action) on more actions eg chart label positioning and marker formatting. 
When you click onto a chart, delve deep into the formatting menu, then click onto another chart, would be good if the formatting menu would open at the same place as you just were.
Ability to add a mini stylesheet or lookup list (eg brands), each item with their own custom formatting (eg column/line colour in a graph). 

Is there any reason why Excel on Mac still looks horrible, like someone messed with the zoom scale?
I want color filters to automatically react to conditional formatting. I've wanted this for years and years. Maybe this will be my day...just maybe.
From a Mac Excel user, my question is simple: Why?

The #ExcelChampMY contest is a cheat and rigged in favour of one contestant. I believe the people who are in charge of this contest for the respective region are responsible for this. So underhanded.

When will DAX(PowerPivot+DataModel) and M(PowerQuery/Get&Transform) make their way to macOS Excel?
Is there a realization with-in the team that the naming around DAX/M/PowerQuery/Get&Transform/PowerPivot/PowerBI is super confusing to people?   
Even if you aren't confused, the vocabulary to explain what these things to other people just isn't there.     For example, Rob Collie has to spend a whole chapter explaining this in the latest version of his DAX book.



Why don't the new Chart Types work with the DataModel?   Will you fix that?   Will the d3.js visualizations from PowerBI make it to Excel?
If I switch my computers region from "English (US)" to "German (Germany)" (where I'm located), it takes 5,3x the time for calculating. Even worse when choosing Hindi: It needs app. 33x the time for calculating (here is the full report: http://professor-excel.com/performance-excel-study/)

What is the reason? Are you going to solve this?
I'd like to easily display a series based off of the same chart using different subsets of the data set.  
You make one chart, and then say, I want to display a set of variations based on this one variable.
This is something that's available in SAS JMP and Tableau and is super useful.

My Surface Book struggles to run Excel. When scrolling through any spreadsheet even an empty one,  it's very laggy and it loads in chunks, to the point where the spreadsheet shows black squares where the spreadsheet hasn't loaded yet. With Excel be more optimised for low end hardware like Excel Mobile?
What type of sadistic person decided to remove the Multi-Document-Inteface!? 

Previously we had the option to either open multiple documents in a single window OR open then in a separate instance of Excel. Now we are forced to open all documents with their own interface window consuming valuable screen real-estate with the ribbon and menu bar that I would rather use to see the contents of my files. 
Boy, it's great they do something like this when everyone who uses the product is working.
MacOS: why can't Pivot tables show all header rows in the subsequent rows without grouping so I can do lookups off of them?
Just use Ctrl-A to select all the cells. Then move your cursor to drag the column widths equal to the column height.  😉
Thanks for the questions - I've edited this post with those details. It will take place at /r/IAmA, and we'll have to get the questions for the team over to that thread. 
[The last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3rid26/we_are_the_microsoft_excel_team_ask_us_anything/) it was on /r/iama and it will be again (you can see it at the little schedule they have on the sub.)   

They have experience handling the AMA process, and much greater exposure than this sub.

We keep you up to date and sticky a link to the AMA here when it start of course, but it'll be hosted on /r/IAMA

Feel free to use this thread brainstorming questions :)

May I please use all my cores?
I didn't notice that until I had a few sheets with 200,000+ lines, at which point I could startup windows in my VM and open the sheet before it would open in MacOS. 
*puts on MS-employee-hat*

That's a great suggestion, you should go make it on https://excel.uservoice.com/  so we can follow up on it! 

*takes off MS-employee-hat*

forreal though, suggestions for changes are followed up on largely based on the uservoice platform "votes", status is updated, etc. And if you check the improvement suggestions from the last AMA, the product team **really** encourages people to use it. 

edit: just to make it clear, I am not an MS-employee, it was just an imaginary hat...
[I asked this last time](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3rid26/we_are_the_microsoft_excel_team_ask_us_anything/cwoam48/) - they're [working on it](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3rid26/we_are_the_microsoft_excel_team_ask_us_anything/cwob6vw/).
Merged cells are an abomination!
As soon as we get an intuitive and quick way to manage tabs.....
I use F&R all the time. I find the Word version of it to be extremely clunky and fairly confusing at times, whereas I always know exactly what to expect with Excel's F&R.
It used to work that way, with focus on the Find textbox. I don't know why they changed it. Focus on Replace makes no sense to me.
definitely ask this.  The whole PowerPivot/PowerBI/DAX thing is confusing as hell .
If you are using Office 365 Excel 2016 32-bit usable memory has been recently increased from 2 Gigabytes to 4 Gigabytes under Windows 64 bit.
there's a person named excel-evator on this sub. genius...
P sure this guy will be square enough for all of us...

In pivot tables? If not, do a find and replace 
RemindMe! 9 days  "Excel AMA Time!"
Solution Verified
But... that's cheating?
Thanks for the clarification! I guess the questions I'd like to ask them are these:

* Will VBA ever be replaced with VB.NET? (Or the .NET Framework?)

* Will other scripting languages be incorporated into the Office Suite?
Actually the latest update is multi-core... supposedly. Still doesn't change the fact it's faster in windows by a significant margin
So we should start posting links here of the issues we create, so we can upvote the ish outta them!
I'm not sure how that would work. You still have to define the range of the vlookup. It would require a total restructure of how vlookup works and how the function is written.
I do remember that, it was a good question! 
I don't disagree, but occasionally one need to work with a co-worker's workpapers.
I agree. I much more prefer doing the below:
-Select cells
-Right-click to go to *Format Cells*
-Alignment Tab, In Text Alignment, under Horizontal, Select **Center Across Selection**
Yesssss, so much this.
The gap between the quality of excel and word is as wide as any I know. excel is probably the most influential software in the world. Microsoft word is so clunky an irritating to use by comparison.

I'll take either.  Just wish they were the same.

I think at least javascript is being worked on:

Haha I'll believe it when I can process more than a 4x50000 data sheet without waiting minutes....
I actually am fine using index/match for left lookups, but the way I see the function syntax would be...  =vlookup2(value, table, match_column, return_column, match_type)

Go to Excel MVP Chris Newman's site and [download his free Center Across Selection add-in](https://www.thespreadsheetguru.com/blog/add-center-across-selection-button-to-excel-home-tab).
The Excel-JS API is already available but currently only supports a subset of the Excel object model and methods.
so not a left lookup (index <0) just a floating "match" column. I agree that's a good solution, as I finally figured out when explaining vlookup you need to tell people there's a "secret" variable, which is the first column you select. Only way to convey it.

something like this 

=vlookup(a1,G:M,3,2,false) would look up a1 in column I and return the value in column H
Perfect. Thank you :)
You've entered too many arguments for that function. What is it you are trying to convey?
dude, read the thread. It's about a fictional vlookup update that could do negative index column matching.

Dude. 

You ever walk up to a group at a party and they're in the middle of a conversation and you poorly try to inject your opinion without knowing the context? 

I bet it would be nice if you had a written transcript of the moments preceding your arrival in the conversation so you could prepare and make sure you didn't say something foolish.

we literally were discussing a topic, you read the last comment, which presumably means you saw but skipped over reading the parents (also ignoring the many context clues IN THE COMMENT ITSELF) and stumbled in, putting your foot in your mouth.

Yes, you should apologize, but it's because AGAIN you've missed the point and put your foot in your mouth. The PROPER, well adjusted, polite and self confident response is not a smarmy "Ooh, I apologize for learning." what you should said was:

"Oops! Excuse me, I was speed reading through the thread and its my fault for failing to parse the whole meaning of the thread and coming in from left field with a question I easily admit I would never have asked, had I done the generally accepted process of actually understanding the topic at hand before randomly posting something."
