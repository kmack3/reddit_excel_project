All Excel functions by category, with actually helpful examples. My favorite function reference.
Great resource. Thank you!
That was an awesome source, and thank you very much for sharing it.  I use Excel a lot and foresee spending quite a bit of time on that site.  

Thank you!
Nice coverage, but why is it missing "like"?  example of code using it:

    Public Function IsAZ(CellRef As Range) As Boolean
        Dim UsedCell As Range
        Dim TexVal As Long
        Dim Alph As String
        
        IsAZ = True
    
        For Each UsedCell In CellRef
            If Len(UsedCell.Value) > 0 Then
                For TexVal = 1 To Len(UsedCell.Value)
                    Alph = Mid(UsedCell.Value, TexVal, 1)
                    If Not (UCase(Alph) Like "[A-Z.,!?;: ]") Then
                        IsAZ = False
                        TexVal = Len(UsedCell.Value)
                    End If
                Next TexVal
            Else
                IsAZ = False
            End If
        Next UsedCell
    
    End Function
