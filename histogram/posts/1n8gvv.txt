10 cool ways to use Excel's conditional formatting feature
Why is there no way to format a cell based on the (RGB) values of three other cells?
A nice read, thanks.
Thanks!

With conditional formatting only that seem a little bit complicated, but vba might open up possibilities...
You could do it using conditional formatting if the RGB values of the other cells were themselves conditionally formatted based on contents. You would just make the rule for the cell dependant on the values of the other cells, rather than the color. The end effect being the same.
