Using excel for study guide?
Create or use sheet two and duplicate the headers there. Then highlight the cells that would have the data and go to Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Use a Formula.. > Insert the formula below in the box 

    =AND(B2<>"",B2=Sheet1!B2)

Click format button > Fill Tab > Select green > OK > OK

Then repeat the steps but use the formula below and select red

    =AND(B2<>"",B2<>Sheet1!B2)
Check out conditional formatting if you specifically want to use colours. I just use an "if" statement in an adjacent cell that displays "OK" if my answer is correct. 
Will do! Thanks!
thank you so much! do you know if theres an easy way to ignore text order?

so like here where it says "big shoulder" if i type it in exactly like that im good but if i type "shoulder big" it comes incorrect

i want to try and set this as a study guide where memorizing word order isnt as important as making sure i have all the words there to speak. if i could do that as easily as creating the original spreadsheet for the rest of my studying that would be awesome!
I think there is a "fuzzy match" add in that can do something like that but I've never used it.
