Detecting Non-Empty Cells
Well space is just as a valid character as "a" or "1". But `TRIM` will remove leading and trailing spaces, and `CLEAN` will remove nonprinting characters (space is a printing character). So something like `=IF(LEN(CLEAN(TRIM(A1)))>0, ... , ...)` would work

>For context, I'm trying to detect the cells with dates in them, so if there are any better ways to do that, that would work as well

So dates are just numbers to Excel. `ISNUMBER(A1)` is what you want. And if you want somewhat valid dates, `AND(ISNUMBER(A1),A1>=DATE(2017,1,1))` is good, or `AND(ISNUMBER(A1),YEAR(A1)=2017)`.

Although it's worth noting that unless you manually changed the cell alignment, I can see from your screenshot that you don't have dates in there now. The text "06/02" is not a date. So I would very highly recommend that you use dates (if you're not already, I just know numbers default to right alignment, text defaults to left). Otherwise you can use workarounds like `NOT(ISERROR(DATEVALUE(A1)))`, but that's just not a good solution vs using dates in the first place.
Try search replace to remove those pesky spaces.

Select all the cells and search replace space with nothing > Options > Match entire cell contents > OK
