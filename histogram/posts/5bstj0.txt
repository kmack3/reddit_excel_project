Practice excel tasks/projects for beginners?
I did this to teach Excel to my girlfriend:

[Exercise 01: Managing Strings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-P0Yg5PWRJ6WOwWJLojcaQFF7HVt3UscsLwvSBL388M/edit#gid=878050816)

She dump me. She left me for a guy who didn't know how to format a cell. Someone told me that they are learning excel together now.
Search YouTube for Excel Magic Trick #1.  It's a series of 1000+ short Excel tutorials with downloadable workbooks for practice.   It's run by a college professor and is really great. 
1 Make a table in one sheet with a list of products (onion, tomato, potato), vendors, quantities and few additional columns, like "country of origin", "taste rated 1 to 5", "brand" ("data" tab)

2 Make a 2nd sheet with products, vendors and their prices. ("pricelist")

3A Use VLOOKUP to add prices to your sample purchases on basis of glued vendor/product

3B. Calculate total price per each line item

4A. Change the goods and vendors in your "data" to data validation, so that you select data it instead of inputting it.

4B. Make data validation "floating" (automatically adds new items to your list; not a static list of say 30 choices)

5 Input like 50 products to your "data" tab

6 Make a pivot table on basis of "data" tab - to do some sample analyses: sales per country of origin; average ranking of manufacturers (that: taste 1-5)

Second project would be to make  a simple home budget, where you collect actual spending, have budgeted spending and compare your actuals vs a budget to see variances. Then you would do a sort of a variance analysis (e.g. food more than budgeted by x%)
Have you gone through the wiki and the side bar learning materials?
An idea just dawned on me reading your question. Go to lendingclub.com and download their raw data files of loan performance over time. Practice excel tutorials on that. 


Here's a simple worksheet you can do 

On B1 Put 1, Put B2, put =B1+1. Drag this to J1. This should equal 9.

On A2, Put 1, on A3, put A2+1. Drag this down to A10.

On B2. Put the formula, $A2*B$1 and drag it to fill the table.

On A12, Do a data validation with the list of A2:A10

On A13, Do a data validation with the list B1:J1.

On A14. Do an Index Match Match formula like this 

=INDEX($A$1:$J$10,MATCH($A$12,$A$1:$A$10,0),MATCH($A$13,$A$1:$J$1,0))

Congratulations, you have now learned the basics of Index Match Match.

I hope her formulas treat numbers as text.
Yeah, I have, most of those are either articles or video lessons. Couple of people on those wiki threads are suggesting to get myself a project to work on which is basically what I'm looking at, but made as a test, with wide array of required Excel features.
=isnumber()  false. I hope I haven't embarrassed myself. Just a noob comment. 
and her dates as numbers!
