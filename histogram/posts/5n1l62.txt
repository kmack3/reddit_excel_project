Question from a college student looking to boost his resume and start his career.
I really like [ExcelIsFun](https://www.youtube.com/user/ExcelIsFun/about) on YouTube. 2700 videos, including start-to-finish courses in Business Analytics ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BM5b4eHiDUo&list=PLrRPvpgDmw0mSJCZaqQPFj0eto4qnzkCZ), used in an actual online class), advanced topics, easy learning style, downloadable workbooks, and some just genuine insights and clever tricks.

So of course learn Pivot tables if you don't already, and all the 'old' Excel intermediate stuff like Solver, array formulas, and named ranges. 

Knowing Get and Transform (nee Power Query), Power Pivot, and DAX will show you're up to date (but requires a lot of investment). If you ever need or want to create a sheet for recruiters, know how to create an interactive dashboard,  get data from online services, maybe create a cool Power Map display based on real-world data.
VBA. Not even kidding as much VBA as you can possibly perform. Power Query, PowerPivot, etc. are definitely stuff that's on the cusp of the technology but if you can automate your own work so that you can do even more work that's the stuff people will care about.
Literally got out of bed to write this, hope you read this before the deal ends! I use Udemy.... alot. I teach myself programming on there. My brother is also in a similar position such as yourself (Bcom grad, in finance). He wanted to get really good at Excel, specifically VBA. If you know VBA, Pivot Tables, and nested if, sumifs etc. you will be 95% better than the competition. I can't stress enough knowing VBA in business environments, people will refer to you as a God amongst men. I learned VBA at my previous 2 internships, and solely based on that and my experience landed full time jobs in business analytics/ Big Data.

KK, enough rambling, here is the Udemy course I suggested my brother after vetting it and looking through it myself. Highly recommended! Best of luck!

The complexity of daily Excel usage usually doesn't exceed that of vlookup, index match and pivot tables, in my experience. However, if you want to stand out, what the other poster said about VBA is very true. Your team will love you if you're able to automate tedious tasks in Excel and save them some time. 

I think that rather than having a certificate from some online class that interviewers probably have never heard of, it is better to make your own project, or go above and beyond on an Excel project you are assigned in class, and to be able to speak articulately & passionately to the purpose and architecture of that project. Interviewers will like to see that you take ownership of your work.

Sorry I don't have any specific programs to recommend. I just think it'd be better and more interesting to think of something cool you want to do with Excel and make it into a personal project that you can show off - learn by doing.
Learn [statistics](/r/statistics) and [r](/r/rstats) and you'll be fine
vlookup, index(match,match), pivot tables, and getting a handle on the macro recorder can take you far.
I just completed a course with Wall Street Prep. Not exactly free but they have a cert at the end 
I really enjoyed [*"Predictive Analytics: Microsoft Excel"* by Conrad Carlberg](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B008JWQ8CA), which I found at Barnes and Noble a few years ago. Instead of just VBA and VLookup, he'll show you how to website scrape, do some regression, and other sophisticated things. I read it on train rides to work for a few weeks and it surprised me how much Excel can do.
Full Disclosure: I'm the author of and sell the course mentioned below.

Here is a link to a course that I teach on advanced formulas. It's over 16 hours of practical problems I've faced in the workforce. You'd be looking to start with Module 2.

Where are you from
I'll add this book to my to do list. Thank you!
Have you read our sidebar information.. including [Where to Learn Excel & Advice Megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2e28s3/rexcel_advice_thread_repository/)
In all of my interviews, I can't recall anyone asking me about my excel skills. It's just assumed that anyone coming out of college is able to use excel. I stopped listing it on my resume to make space for skills that actually differentiated me from everyone else. 


And to be completely honest, you shouldn't be trying to blow anyone away with your excel skills if your interviewing for a competitive job.
Thank you so much! This is great and very helpful, except for one thing. The youtube series is perfect, but I was hoping to find an online course where I get a certificate or some type of proof that I actually completed the course and understand advanced excel skills. Do you know of any programs similar to this? Once again thank you so much, I know I will be using this channel for a long time. 
Thank you! I'll keep this in mind. 
I know it's only $10 right now but, couldn't I find the same information for free on YouTube? Or is the course taught in such a way that it's incredibly worth it?
Dude this is awesome.  Enrolled and on it.  Thank you.  Mind if I DM you after regarding next steps? 
Hey no problem, you don't need to recommend a program. You still gave plenty of info that I find very useful thank you! You're definitely right, a project does sound a lot cooler than a couple of certificates, I just need some ideas for a project I could do.. 

I did run my own projections for fantasy sports using player statistics and different functions and variables using Excel, but I wonder if that would be appropriate in a business setting interview. 
Subscribed to those subreddits. Thanks for your help!
Vlookup I know like the back of my hand. Im not an expert at index, and Im okay at pivot tables, but I feel I am more comfortable at MS Access and using queries than using pivot tables oddly enough. I've had limited experience. I unfortunately haven't used macro recorder, but thanks to you now I know what I need to get started working on!
Thanks that's exactly what Im looking for! I should've specified that I don't mind taking a paid course. I'll do some research on this thank you!
I've seen your modules before. Interestingly enough, I found it by searching on Google before I found it here and I almost signed up without using the coupon code! Your work is a godsend by the way, Im already impressed from the minuscule amount I've read about your modules. 
Arkansas
I have, but I didn't find the right information I was looking for and I wanted to find specific info for my specific case. I won't lie though I didn't dissect it all so if you recommend I do that I'll look through it more thoroughly!
Certificates don't really mean a lot to be honest. You might think about listing some Excel projects you've completed on your resume instead as a demonstration of your abilities. Like the dashboard idea above.

Cool certificate and it flys by pretty quick: https://openeducation.blackboard.com/mooc-catalog/courseDetails/view?course_id=_219_1
If you decide to to learn VBA, let me know and I can give a few tips for things I wish I had known when I first started using VBA. 
Welp, nevermind, bought it lol.
Not a problem! DM me any questions you have, i'd be happy to help out
Yes. Just don't focus on the gambling aspect of it (if done for $). As an interviewer, I understand if excel wasn't used in depth in school, but if you're explaining how you used it functionally in real life, I understand that you are a) able to use it as a powerful tool at work and b) probably have some problem solving ability. (Disc. I work in professional services not traditional consulting so if others have more rigid expectations of big consulting/accounting interviews they should weigh in.)

Once you start using macro recorder, learn how to safely remove the things like:

    Range("A1").Select
    
and

    ActiveWindow.ScrollRow = X
    ActiveWindow.ScrollColumn = X

Once I learned to remove these types of things, not only did I understand VBA better, but my code executed far faster. Turning code snippets that run in 30 minutes that you can optimize and run in <1 second is an amazing feeling.
> s before. Interestingly enough, I found it by searching on Google before I found it here and I almost signed up without using the coup

Well today is your lucky day! :) Thanks for the kind words and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about making the transition from college to a professional career. I'm always happy to help out when I can.
Learning is all about studying information given to you and discerning what is helpful to you and what is not..

If, at this early stage, you are already discounting information unless handed on a plate, you should consider if you are suited to an internship where they are likely to want a 'self starter'  - someone who can find information, and internalise, digest, and act on upon said information without being hand held along each increment .. just sayin'  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

post set to discussion.
This. I just brought screenshots from a few projects I worked on. And a seperate sheet on how I made the formula's. Got me hired instantly. Also know how to google.
This looks solid. Thanks for your contribution!
About to start down the VBA path and requesting said tips!
Also beginning to learn VBA. Anything you could offer would be great
Can you pm that my way? Thanks!
I've been working in VBA for a while now, and I'd still be happy to hear any tips you might have =D
You could find this information anywhere, but I liked about the course for my brother is that it starts and focuses from all the simple concepts following through to more complex VBA coding. It'll provide a very good foundation for yourself looking to improve Excel skills overall
Noted! I have shared the fantasy football work with a recruiter at an interview and although I do spend money, I was careful enough to avoid sharing that. 
I'll keep that in mind! You've been a great help and I really appreciate it. 
Nothing is being handed to me. All Im getting is "learn x and y", and that's exactly what I asked for. I didn't ask or receive any summaries of the YouTube videos, or given key posts in the suggested subreddits, and I don't need to ask for that. I can figure that out on my own I would imagine the learning part takes place when Im actually trying to learn the excel skills, but I guess you disagree.  Thanks for your input!
The first thing you need to do is add the developer tab to your ribbon. To do this click File>Options>Customize ribbon>Developer then O.K.

In the developer tab, click record macro, macro name cannot contain spaces. You have two options for where the macro code will be stored, ThisWorkbook and the personal macro workbook. The personal macro workbook will allow you to add a macro button to your quick access toolbar so the code can be used from whatever workbook you happen to be on. ThisWorkbook option will allow you create a macro button for that specific workbook, this makes it easier for co-workers to use your macro because they just have to click the button. To add a macro button to ThisWorkbook, in the the developer tab, click insert then the first option, "Button (Form Control)"

Once you have clicked record and then stop record, you can now access the code by clicking Visual Basic on the left of the developer tab, then click the expand button for your project(PERSONAL.XLSB for personal macros) then click the expand button for Modules, then click on the module.

The macro can be run by clicking macros then select your macro and hit run, in the developer tab. Or add a button to the top left of the window in all workbooks File>Options>Quick Access Toolbar>Choose Commands From>Macros Then select your macro and click Add and then Modify to choose an icon for your button.

**For this tutorial I will go through how to turn the raw data in bellow workbook into an accounts receivable report with the personal macro option.**

https://ptpb.pw/hKCx.xls

The first thing I would add to the code at the top is:

     With Application

     .DisplayAlerts = False

     .AskToUpdateLinks = False

     .ScreenUpdating = False

     .DisplayStatusBar = False

     .EnableEvents = False

     End With

     'put a comma at the beginning of the line to add a comment within your code. 

This will make your macro more efficient. The display alerts option will make the macro automatically select the default option when a message appears. For example, if the macro deletes a worksheet the user will not have to click delete on the message.

And at the bottom of the code


     With Application 

     .DisplayAlerts = True 

     .AskToUpdateLinks = True 

     .ScreenUpdating = True 

     .DisplayStatusBar = True 

     .EnableEvents = True 

     End With

Above is the same as typing


     Application.DisplayAlerts = True

     Application.AskToUpdateLinks = True

Etc.

To declare your variable type Dim (variable name) As (variable type) Bellow are the variables used for this project


     Dim awb as Workbook


     Set awb = ActiveWorkbook

For Workbooks and Worksheets you need to use the "Set". You can pick any variable name as long as it isn't something like a VBA function. To reference a range it is helpful to include the full path like this: Workbook.Sheet.Range

The sheet could be refereed to by it's name like this: awb.Sheets("Sheet 2")

Or by the position the worksheet is in the workbook, for example: awb.Sheets(2)

Above references the sheet that is second to left. It is better to use this method if possible but the first option is better if the position of the sheet might change.


     Dim S1 as Worksheet


     Set S1 = awb.Sheets(1)




     Dim BT As Long 


     BT = S1.Range("A2").Value

This makes it easier to refer to the Bill To number in A2 later in the code. The variable remains static. For example if range A2 gets deleted. The variable is still whatever number was in A2 at the time the variable was set. Long is the variable type for longer numbers, if it's a shorter number Integer can be used.


     Dim CN As String


     CN = S1.Range("B2").Value



     Dim CR As String


     CR = S1.Range("H2").Value

String is the variable type for text. CN is the company name and CR is the currency used. Since the raw data does not have the columns fit, use:

 
     S1.Columns("A:H").AutoFit

Now we will create a header for the accounts receivable report:


     S1.Rows("1:5").Insert


     S1.Range("A1").Value = CN


     S1.Range("A2").Value = "CUSTOMER#" & BT

Note that "&" is used to combine text of your choice and the the variable. Note that instead of using the variable you could refer directly to range like this:


     S1.Range("A1").Value = S1.Range("A7").Value

**This is more efficient than copying and pasting.**


     S1.Range("A3").Value = "A/R BALANCE AS OF " & Date

In this case "&" is used to combine text and the VBA function Date. Date returns the current date. If you wanted a time stamp you could use Format(Now(), "mm-dd-yyyy hhmm AMPM")

Next we will highlight the past due invoices as indicated by the date in column F being less than today's date.

**The first thing you want to do is determine the last row in the data.** To find out what is the last row that has data in column A use below code:


     Dim rc As Long


     rc = S1.Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row

What this is doing is the equivalent of going to the bottom of the workbook in column A and then using Ctrl+Up to get to the last cell with data. The .Row returns the row number of that cell. Now we want to loop through from row 7 to the last row with data. To do this we use


     For i = 7 To rc

     If S1.Range("F" & i).Value < Date Then

     S1.Range("A" & i  & ":H" & i).Interior.ColorIndex = 6

     End If

     Next i

So first it checks if F7 is less than today's date, if it is then highlight A7:H7 then it moves on to F8 and continues down to the last row. If you want to start at row 1 then you would us i = 1 instead of i = 7

Now to sum the total invoices


     S1.Range("G" & rc + 2).Value = Application.Sum(S1.Range("G7:G" & rc).Value)

This sets the cell in column G that is two rows bellow the last row with data equal to the sum of G7:G(last row with data)

Now to sum the past due invoices where the date in column F is less than today's date


     S1.Range("G" & rc + 4).Value = Application.SumIf(S1.Range("F7:F" & rc), "<" & Date,   S1.Range("G7:G" & rc))

To set the currency and descriptions of above sums


     S1.Range("A" & rc + 2).Value = "TOTAL:"


     S1.Range("A" & rc + 4).Value = "PAST DUE:"


     S1.Range("H" & rc + 2).Value = CR


     S1.Range("H" & rc + 4).Value = CR

To put the invoice totals in comma format:


     S1.Range("G7:G" & rc + 4).Style = "Comma"

And to highlight the last row


     S1.Range("A" & rc + 4 & ":H" & rc + 4).Interior.ColorIndex = 6

And to set the tab name equal to the company name


     S1.Name = CN

And to freeze the first 6 rows


     Application.Goto S1.Range("A7")


     ActiveWindow.FreezePanes = True

Now to set the directory(folder) where the file will be saved based on the company name and Bill To number


      Dim folder As String


     folder = "C:\path\to\my\folder\" & CN & "#" & BT & "\"

Note that you need to include "\" at the end and change to path in quotes to the parent folder where you want to save it.

We want to save it in the above folder with the file name based on the company name, Bill To number and today's date. First we will check if the folder already exists and create it if not.


     If Dir(folder, vbDirectory) = "" Then MkDir folder

Note that the If statement above does not require an "End If" because "MkDir folder" is on the same line as "If"

And to save it in that folder


     S1.SaveAs FileName:=folder & CN & "#" & BT & " " & Format(Date, "mm-dd-yyyy") & ".xls", FileFormat:=xlExcel8

I hope this example is useful to you and good luck with your VBA projects! Let me know if you have any questions.

For instance, I've created many excel workbooks that are nothing more than a crazy amount of INDEX/MATCH, SUMIFS, COUNTIFS, and some custom UDFs through VBA. I've measured the amount of time I've saved my company in terms of man hours by creating such things over the 10 years I've been there.

I've literally saved the company an entire person working for 10 years worth of manhours. It is extraordinarily common to see someone working on something in excel by hand, that can be automated. Learn how to automate those things.

The most recent baby project was fairly simple. 10 sub organizations have a copy of a master spreadsheet, and are responsible for correcting their organizations rows in the spreadsheet. The person in charge of compiling this was opening each sheet, filtering the data to down to the organization it came from (which was contained in the filename) and copying those rows into a new workbook. All in all this took about 25 minutes for him to do, and he's been doing it for about 2 years (thus he's good at it by now). Yesterday, in about 25 minutes I was able to reduce that process down to about 30 seconds via a macro. Granted this process is only done monthly, so it's not a giant cost savings, but it is still about 5 man hours a year back to the company, and back to the person himself.

Find ways you can do this for your future employers, and you will make yourself invaluable.
**Intern**: Hey there new boss, I know a lot about your company, but can you tell me more?

**Boss**:  Have a read through this booklet, it tells you all about our company and what we stand for.

**Intern**:  Yeh, I've done that, but I didn't take it in, can you tell me the important bits to read..

**Boss**:  .......!!??......
You really took this to a place I was unprepared for I was simply going to say try YouTube or Google. (But seriously thanks for putting up such a great post for others)
Im looking for information for my personal situation, and you recommended a source based on others input. In your example, Im using a source based on a company to find information on a company instead of myself or some other third party. The analogy almost worked though!

I'll just leave it at this, I see where you're coming from and I respect your opinion. I disagree with your position, but nonetheless you have a valid argument and I'll respect that. Thanks for your help!
