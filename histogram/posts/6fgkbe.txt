How do i create this kind of list
Cell B1 should have the formula below (found online-seems to work), then autofill all the way down.

    =IF(A1=2,"Prime",IF(AND(MOD(A1,ROW(INDIRECT("2:"&ROUNDUP(SQRT(A1),0))))<>0),"Prime","Not Prime"))


Click C to highlight all of column C > Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Use a formula > enter formula below

    =B1="Prime"

Click Format button > Fill Tab > Select Green > ok > ok


Repeat the steps for column C again, but use the following formula and choose Red instead of Green.

    =B1="Not Prime"

Cell D2 formula below then autofill all the way down

    =COUNTIF(B1:$B$1,"Prime")
This is the formula to determine if a number is prime:

    =IF(A2=2,"Prime",IF(AND(MOD(A2,ROW(INDIRECT("2:"&ROUNDUP(SQRT(A2),0))))<>0),"Prime","Not Prime"))

From there, you could do a count if cells say PRIME
Pasting the first formula you had written brings out "The formula you typed contains an error" 
i have also tried to Ctrl + Shitf + Enter
"The formula you typed contains an error"
Are you in a country that uses , for a decimal? If so, you may have to replace the , symbols above with ;
fixes the problem, but deosent do the job
