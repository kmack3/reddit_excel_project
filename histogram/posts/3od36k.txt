ModelOff 2015 (Financial Modeling World Championships) round 1 is next Saturday (17 October)
I won't take part in the competition, but still this came just in time! I was looking for ways to work on my excel skills. The past questions are perfect for that. I already solved the Snakes and Ladders one. Good fun! Thank you =)
The competition looks like it could be a lot of fun. Very impressive you made the finals last year. Good luck to you and thanks for letting people know this is a thing.
It looks like a really cool event, but after spending a bit of time and despite thinking I have reasonable excel skills, it seems that I have a lot more to learn!
Awesome stuff! Best of luck for this year boys! 
So where does one find the actual excel files of winning models for past ModelOffs? 
Nice!
Not trying to convince you, but for the benefit of anyone else reading: they are tough challenges. A common thought amongst first time finalists was "the first two rounds were hard and I didn't think I did very well so I was surprised to make the final".
Past questions are on the following page. The ones marked "worked solution" have model answers. You won't find the excel files that contestants submitted - expect those to be less polished as there is a lot of time pressure during the competition.
