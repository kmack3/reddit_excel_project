Udemy as the coupon text do you mean? 
Nope, you can just sign up now and take the class in the future.
once you start the class you have it forever
There's no catch. It's a paid course turned free.
Best I can think of is that once you're signed up to the site you may sign up to some paid courses
just did, thanks!
yes there are quizzes at the end of every lecture and there are downloadable xlsm files for some specific lectures.

More likely is signing you up for ad spam for other udemy courses. It's kind of their model.
It says 'service unavailable'   ?
