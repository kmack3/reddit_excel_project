Anyone certified?
If you regularly use Excel, the certification should not be too much of a struggle, but you don't need a certification as much if you have work history using it. For those who have recently learned to use Excel, perhaps in school, but who do not have years of experience, the certification could help you get your foot in the door for some jobs.


Review options:

* [Gmetrix practice tests](https://www.gmetrix.com/Products/ProductDescription/77-727-MOS-Excel-2016-Practice-Tests) - I haven't tried all the products out there myself, but this is the one I hear the best rumors about.

* [Printed Study Guide](https://books.google.com/books?id=hg86DQAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&ots=hgD9XodlUE&dq=mos%2077-727%20study%20guide&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=mos%2077-727%20study%20guide&f=false) - This has the advantage of being very affordable. You can download sample files to try out the skills described in the book if you find topics that you need to practice, though the software does not tell you that you did it right the way Gmetrix does.
I would like to see the results of posters. I have seen people like Bill Jelen advertise themselves as "Excel MVPs".
I am. Don't bother. Literally no one cares - pretty much anyone who has ever gone near Excel could past the exam, and employers know that.
Not certified but it's not hard to exhibit credibility during an interview in my experience.  
I myself am looking to get the certification. I don't have a degree, and I'll take anything that can help set me apart or give me a little legitimacy. If I remember correctly it seems like a lot of people in this sub think it's pointless. But to me, I don't see how it could hurt to have it. Only seems beneficial.  
This cert, along with other MS Office Suite certs are generally used to add another bullet point to your CV. In general they aren't a deal breaker when going up against someone who has them, versus someone who doesn't. Unless an employer is looking for someone specifically for certain tasks involving the Office Suite, I've never seen them make a big deal about these certs.
Is the MSO Excel certification free? 

Oh btw If you're looking to pad up a resume Google Ad Words cert is free. 
Microsoft MVP Awards are not traditional certifications. They are given to experts that make outstanding contributions to their communities. Info here:

For someone who doesn't have a degree like myself, would it not help an employer to not automatically overlook my resume? Meaning even if they think the certification doesn't really mean anything, if a hiring manager looked at my cv would the cert stop them from maybe automatically throwing my application into the garbage?

Edit: or serious question. WhAt should I put on my resume that will help me get a job that requires excel? How do I demonstrate my knowledge, to just get my foot in the door?
Bingo.  
This post is timely though because I've been preparing to take it. Was looking to sign up for the exam next week. I'm interested in hearing the communities opinion on it. 
Thanks for the info!
Yea I'd be interested in a better understanding of the barrier of entry.   I do a lot of work in Excel for my job but I have no idea if my experience is broad enough for any cert or where I would fall in a range of certs if they exist that way.

Not looking to take on much in the way of additional training specifically for the cert but rather to legitimize on paper what I already am capable of.
