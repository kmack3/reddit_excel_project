Excel Skills And Tips - 29 that You Need to Learn - A Tutorial for Beginners
Well done. I didn't watch the whole thing, but you covered a good spread of info. I teach application classes (Office, Adobe, etc.) and it's surprising how many users don't get the basics, even after using the software for years. 

While most people here ask more advanced questions, I'm sure there's more than a few who want to know basic things but are too embarrassed to ask. 

Keep up the good work. 
Great idea for beginners and even experienced users, some of the tips were just awesome!

Thank you for this. I consider myself a beginner at Excel, despite using it for years, I only used it for simple things for school. I want to learn more and use Excel to my advantage. Very helpful!
Been looking to pick up excel in the summer. Too much to do during the spring semester, but now is a great time. Thank you!
Do we have a link that uses the standard URL format? https://www.youtube.com/. I'm deployed and our network blocks the provided URL. Thanks in advance

do you have a tutorial geared towards mac people? some of these shortcuts are really different. 
Thanks I appreciate the kind words.  It took me some time to really think about the list because a lot of these things come as second nature.  The inspiration to building the list came from a friend who was watching do some work in Excel but had no idea how to do some of the small but very helpful skills in Excel.

The video of course could be a little less choppy but I'm still learning the ropes on putting together videos. 

Thanks again @CajuNerd
Thanks - some of them definitely might cross over and be useful to more experience users.   I know I've been using Excel pretty heavily for the past several years and takes sometime to understand some of the key features of Excel that you should really be learning early on.
Thanks for the Idea - I posted it over to /r/finance
Thanks @Sephorria - That one was a super handy one for me as well especially when receiving spreadsheets with different models and trying to understand how they work.  I will indeed continue to make more tutorials - feel free to subscribe to my youtube channel.
No problem.  These are definitely the more simple things that you can learn in Excel that should help you quite a bit.  Thanks for checking it out!
Awesome!  If you subscribe to my you tube channel you'll be able to get more tutorials and tips throughout the summer.  Cheers.

Tho if the shortened url is blocked, chances are this one will be too. 
Something to try next time is writing a script for yourself. Easier to stay on track. And if you have the editing means, just record small segments at a time then combine them later. That's what most of the professionals do.
