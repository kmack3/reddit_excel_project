If column A contains specific text, than fill column C with data. More complex IF function?
You can try this:

    =if(A1="Sugar",.5,if(A1="Cracked Corn",.25,"")

You could keep filling ifs in for the `false` part of the statement if you need to. 
Depending on how many possible values you have/need, the simplistic answer would be to use nested if statement, e.g. in cell C1

    =If($A1="Sugar", 0.5, If($A1="CrackedCorn", 0.25, ""))
A VLOOKUP might do the trick as well. If you have quite a big list then you could simply put them into a value table with Column 1 being "Sugar", "Crack Corn", etc. and Column 2 being the values. 

The formula would then look like:

=VLOOKUP(A1,Value_Table,2,FALSE)
SOLUTION VERIFIED !


both contributors should receive a clippy point!
i guess i dont get how this verifying thing works haha

Solution verified !
We will try right now. Thank you for the quick response! 
This worked. thanks a bunch for helping me out! My problem has been solved! :)
Going to try asap. Thank you!!
Solution verified!

thanks!
Yeah it would be easier to deal with also. In the future you could add whatever you wanted without changing the formula. 

Hello!

And just to clarify, this should work with as many words as needed?  as of right now there are 5 different ingredients that would potentially be nested...

You can just keep filling in more if statements where that last set of " " is. 
It worked! thanks so much. Looks like my friend had tried something similar, but the formula syntax wasnt correct. idk! Thanks again for helping me solve this!
