Thank you all for the awesome resource.
I feel the same way. Thank you everyone. This sub is a diamond in the rough. And it's feels great to be at a point where I see a question and think I can help.
To me, the best part is tasks that used to take a few hours are now done in 10 - 20 minute of looking here and implementing whatever new goodies I've found.
