I have a list of 10 emails in column A and a list of 20 emails in column E. The information in E is related to the data in F and G. What is a formula to find matching emails in E that are in A and then populate Column B and C with the data that is found in F and G that matches that same email?
In B4: INDEX($F$4:$F$10,MATCH($A4,$E$4:$E$10,0)), and copy down.

In C4: INDEX($G$4:$G$10,MATCH($A4,$E$4:$E$10,0)), and copy down.

Enter this formula in to B4, = VLOOKUP(A4,$E$4:$G$10,2,0) and fill down. Use the same formula in C4, just change the "2" in the third argument to a 3 and fill down.
> =VLOOKUP(A4,$E$4:$G$10,2,0)

PERFECT!
