Looking to import live data from the entire NYSE (all 3300 stocks) into a spreadsheet that I can refresh, sort and manipulate.
Do you have access to a Bloomberg terminal? They have an excel add on that I believe should be able to get what you're looking for. Granted getting one for yourself, if you don't have access, would be thousands of dollars.
I've actually built something very similar in the past on Sheets using the built-in GoogleFinance and ImportFeed functions for importing real-time stock metrics and RSS feeds, respectively. Unfortunately, it was extremely slow (as Sheets tends to be with large volumes of data) and I never carried it over to Excel. I will provide my data sources below in hopes that someone more knowledgable than I can possibly expand on how to best integrate these in your spreadsheet.

* [SEC EDGAR](http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=xom&owner=include&action=getcompany) provides RSS feeds for company filings (using XOM as an example here). Form 4's are for insider trading activity.

* [NASDAQ](http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/company-list.aspx) provides lists of stocks currently trading on the 3 major exchanges that you can download. [OTC](http://www.otcmarkets.com/research/companyDirectory) offers the same thing for all OTC exchanges.

I know this isn't a solution, but I hope that it is a good starting point for what you're trying to do.
You could use [smart tags](http://finance.zacks.com/stock-market-data-excel-10826.html) to grab stock prices. I don't know of any way of getting market cap.

>  I'm looking to implement an insider information trading strategy

... I'm sorry? Are you saying you intend to trade with insider information? You know that's illegal right?
I don't have access to a Bloomberg terminal, unfortunately.
This is a great starting point! Would you be willing to share your google sheets template with me? If not, I absolutely understand. 
No, not insider trading. I'm referring to the strategy outlined [here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/121002.asp?layout=infini&v=1B) Additionally, smart tags are useful for retrieving prices, but I was hoping to get more data than just that.
I believe he's trying to detect insider trading
This sort of information could be easily pulled (live) from Bloomberg into excel. Do you need it to be live or just a snapshot from a particular date? If you need live data, a subscription service may be your only way.

Trading in line with trades placed legally by insiders.  He should be scraping Edgar, not Yahoo Finance.
Live is ideal, but not necessary. I just need to have a format where I can refresh the data daily.
This will work, the only issue being that I cant pull the entire NYSE. I'll have to enter in ticker symbols manually. 
NYSE, NASDAQ, and AMEX [lists are all available here](http://www.nasdaq.com/screening/company-list.aspx) as CSV files.

Download and import to your doc.
Gotcha, thank you for all the help!
