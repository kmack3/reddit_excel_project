Is there any way to change the display have all worksheet tabs listed along the left side of the screen?
Looks like there are a couple options - KUTools, some VBA code, or right clicking to show it as a separate window being the most common. From a quick google search:

Thank you for the idea!! 

Going to write some JS for a Google Sheets that has gotten unruly. 
Another suggestion is a home screen with Command buttons taking you to each page you need.

Ooh, I kinda like that. I imagine I'd make it its own macro book with a function to select which workbook it points to, then have button options based on which book you chose. Then you can have it as a separate window on the edge of your screen (AKA on the laptop's monitor instead of the main monitor) and don't need to go back to a given tab in the book you're actually working in.

edit: I really want to do this right now, it's a shame I have so much else to do today at work.
