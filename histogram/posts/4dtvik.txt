I hear you want to learn PowerBI & PowerPivot better, come'on in, see what we have in store for you! (Round 2!)
Oooh, an excel competition, count me in!
Could someone please clarify fraction_votes? I'm not at all familiar with US election system. Also is FIPS basically a ZIP code?
Cheers, nice competition!
Now I do not know enough about voting in America to be sure, but there seems to be a problem with Maine?
Do you have criteria on how you will be selecting winners? 
awwww yissss, but I am not that great at visualizations. I'll try nonetheless!
Do y'all have a way to account for charting limitations between different versions of excel? Or are we supposed to try our best with whatever software version we have?
How do I activate power view, power map, power pivot, etc.?
So do we post our hosted URLs here?

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-qeq5UzBE20cENDckwwZWp0WDA/view?usp=sharing

No idea if Google Drive sharing links let you download as well
Remindme! 4/10/2016 "excel challenge-get on it!"
So are we able to just upload our data file to google drive and then send you  a link? Do we need to alter any settings to allow someone to access that link? Haven't done something like that before.
My submission is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mglzoja382sy4oy/2016-04-08%20-%20u-_Usari_%20-%20PowerPivot%20Contest%20Submission.xlsx?dl=0). Thanks for putting on this contest, it was a lot of fun! Best of luck to everyone entering! EDIT: I couldn't get my data labels to stay white, they would revert to black, including after I saved and closed.
It's my first time doing a visualization so hopefully it's good!

So are we supposed to use power view and or power pivot? Office 360 2016 doesn't include them I believe. 
Didn't have much time today but figured I'd submit something since it looks like the competition is wide open.

Can't get Power View to work so [Power Map!](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/23843228/primary_results.xlsx)

First time using this. Fun feature.
Seems that I didn't make the cut, so I will purchase. If I get the book listed above, does that mean I do not need [this](http://www.amazon.com/DAX-Formulas-PowerPivot-Simple-Revolution/dp/1615470158/ref=pd_sim_14_6?ie=UTF8&dpID=51be0TTwLyL&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL320_SR244%2C320_&refRID=15AN1D9E5Q3ZA3DWM2Z5) or [this](http://www.amazon.com/PowerPivot-Alchemy-Patterns-Techniques-Excel/dp/1615470212/ref=pd_sim_14_6?ie=UTF8&dpID=51cBpfZrs8L&dpSrc=sims&preST=_AC_UL320_SR242%2C320_&refRID=1AKK5WS15DY26WD3BCMW) book as their contents are covered in your new one?
Can one decline the book if chosen as a winner?

I don't have a lot more shelf space for dead tree products and would rather someone who truly wants it to have it.
FIPS is state (first two digits) & county (next 3 digits). [Here's a reference](https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/codes/cou.html)
> fraction_votes

I'm assuming it's the fraction of total votes. e.g. in the first row Donald Trump got 44.5% of total votes.
Each party conducts their own primary election in each state, and they don't necessarily do them at the same time.

So Nebraska, Maine, and Colorado have only held one primary.
Not specifically, but there is a [difference](http://i.imgur.com/EgORMUD.png) between no effort and a little effort....
That is all we are asking for... get people to try... only way to improve is with practice!
> try our best with whatever software version we have

This.  We are hoping to have people that have put effort into it.  We do understand there is a difference between 2016 and 2003 (maybe even 97, if anyone is still using that), and we would hope version would not be as much as a contributing factor, but we do understand that making something "look good" in 97 requires MUCH MORE effort than in 2016...
[Hmm....](http://i.imgur.com/I3OZYhD.png)
Yup, perfect, that was pretty quick!  Thanks!

Btw, google docs view butchers the downloadable version...

Yup, just upload and post here... nope as long as we have VIEW access we should be able to see/download the file.
Yeah, in Google Drive, right click on the file -> Share -> Choose "Anyone with link can view" and then link away.
Thanks for participating, got it saved!
Great job !  One suggestion, with dark colored bars, it's best to have light colored data labels - plus then you'd have red, *white*, and blue in your viz.
Aww yisss 3D - has anyone done Power Map in Cardboard/Rift/Vive yet?
Sweet, did you use PowerBI or just Power Map?
Any way to show the data seems to be allowed, just be creative!
Nope don't have to, and it is included (you just have to enabled it, they are really pushing PowerBI)...
The prize book is the second edition of the book in your first link.

The second one is more of an extremely practical cookbook so when have situation X you can just pull up the book and apply solution Y. I've been doing DAX for 4 years and know it probably as well as anyone and it's still a go-to book.
Of course!  I am hoping to try and get a bi-weekly challenge going for people to play with just for fun, as a challenge.  Now that I have found Kaggle and /r/datasets I think it may be a little easier to manage, but that is a whole other conversation...
I meant that they had 101 people voting total in the whole of Maine
Thank you.  Wasn't certain if there was criteria for titles, labels, size, etc.  thank you for putting this contest together, I think it's awesome!  
Serious, excel isn't friendly when it comes to these things. Tired to activate power view and it's still greyed out.
Thanks for the feedback! I actually had it as white text (see my edit), but Excel kept reverting to the default black text after any calculation/close of workbook. I couldn't get it to keep. I thought of embedding a .jpg in the Excel file but I think that goes against the spirit of the competition.
That would be awesome! Doing this inspired me to try PowerBI and it's as awesome as I thought it would be.

VR integration should become a thing
~~The map was just the 3D maps feature in Excel 2016~~
Power Map

I made a separate project with PowerBI although I'm sure I just cracked the surface of its potential.

~~Only thing about powerBI is that the reports are hard to share based on what I know how to do so far, maybe someone here knows a good way to share them!~~

Edit: figured out how to share reports!

Edit 2: I used PowerMap, didn't know there was no difference before!
Great, thank you for the info! Is DAX considered a language?
Nope, it is up to you to decide how you want to display/format the data!
Go to Options > Add-Ins > Manage: COM Add-Ins >

Make sure they are checked as enabled.
I did this, but it is greyed out in my ribbon, any other work arounds?
What version of Excel?  (also as a sidenote, powerpivot and powerview are not mandatory for use for this exercise)

Do you have the PowerPivot Ribbon bar at least? just everything is grayed out?
I used this [guide](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-on-Power-View-in-Excel-2016-for-Windows-f8fc21a6-08fc-407a-8a91-643fa848729a) and have that new button on the ribbon but grayed out. I have 2016
Go back to your add-ins, remove the check, click okay all the way out, then go back in, and re-enable, see if that kickstarts it... 

Other than that, I don't know, very odd... 
I have the powerpivot ribbon now and the power view button, both still grayed out.

edit: nvm, seems to not work with CSV file, I didn't resave your file as an xls.
You definitely need to add that "Save as XLSX" step to  the contest instructions at top, I had the same issue, I just luckily figured it out.
