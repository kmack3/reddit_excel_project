Going from public to private accounting. Told I need to learn vlookup and pivot tables. Where/How do I start?
You can learn both of those things in two hours or less, up to intermediate levels. 

YouTube. 
If you know sum, you should learn SUMIF and SUMIFS as well. Also learn to use your keyboard for navigation. I essentially don't touch my mouse at any point now 
Lookup INDEX(MATCH()) instead of VLOOKUP, it does the same thing but with more flexibility and efficiency. VLOOKUP requires your data to be a specific order (it only works left to right), while INDEX(MATCH()) can lookup in any order and can do composite (more than 1 criteria) searched. 
On YouTube there's the channel "excelisfun". This guy is great. He'll teach you everything you need to know.  He'll be sure to teach you keyboard shortcuts as you go as well.

Chandoo.org is my favorite site for when I was first learning Excel, that would be my recommendation.
I'm an engineer and vllookup, indexmatch, and pivot tables are something I use on a freakishly regular basis. Maybe I should be an accountant? 
www.rondebruin.nl is one of the best resources out there. His Excel Bible has a workbook for every single function - really amazing stuff. Delves into VBA as well.

Perfect. I'll be working on it tonight :) I'm excited about my new job but sad I'm leaving the current. 
Yes. When working almost enitrely with numbers, I find SUMIFS and COUNTIFS much, much easier and more useful. For me Index + Match (and any {arrays}) are niche, although to each their own.
I'm super huge on keyboard shortcuts I don't like to use my mouse so I will definitely make it a point to be this way with excel. 
Got it. Ok. 
How do you do index(match()) with multiple criteria? 
How do you do multiple criteria?
+1 for excelisfun. I did his vlookup tutorial and learned quite a bit 
Used the app. Thanks for the link. 
Thank you 
What kind of an engineer are you? 
Ok great. Thank you for this 
Not to self promote, but I've curated a few useful videos for my students (for free) on Alym.com (mods, feel free to delete if this isn't okay). 
COUNTIF is a godsend. My coworkers used to look up duplicate accounts using a pivot table and count. I blew their mind with countif
Definitely learn INDEX(MATCH()), but I think I'd probably practice VLOOKUP first. I feel like people obsess about INDEX(MATCH()). I suppose it depends what you're trying to do but 9 times out of 10 VLOOKUP works fine for me and is quicker to set up. 

I went from public to private myself, one of the best changes I ever made in my life. Good luck to you. One nice (Excel related) thing is that the awesome spreadsheet you create this year will ACTUALLY be used next year. I felt like I'd spend so much work in public creating a nice spreadsheet only for processes to change, client reports being different year to year, moving to different clients, etc. It's nice to just have a job and be able to own all the pieces.

I'm bad at describing this but if normal is:

=index(Source,match(ref1,RefColumn1,0)), then multi criteria match is:
=index(Source,match(ref1&ref2,RefColumn1&RefColumn2,0))

Enter with Ctrl+shft+entr (array formula)

The link to deskbright.com is for matching horizontal in addition to vertical, but only one vertical criteria.
It's an array that uses the & operator between criteria and the lookup columns, I can type up a better example when I get back to my computer, I'm on mobile right now. 
Usually you can use a sumifs formula to get the same result easier (it it's a number).
    =Match(A1&B1&C1,D:D&E:E&F:F,0)

Use ctrl+shift+enter to tell excel it's an array formula and you'll see curly brackets around it. 

Don't actually use full column lookup ranges in a linear search like this or your computer will hate you. 
aha! did not know the app bypasses all advice on sub reddit submissions advice.. interesting!

edit: this is not a sarcastic reply, it is a [TIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/) moment.

edit2: so many downvotes, so many mobile users ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
that is a loaded question, um.... materials mostly.  just check my top comment history you'll figure it out ;)
This is more than ok. Thank you for sharing!  I will make sure to take a look at it tonight. 
Mistake-finding + filtering (1-2 punch) = mind blown for good co-workers. Your bad co-workers will think you got lucky and treat it with contempt/distrust. Unfortunately it's 50/50 where I work currently. Sorry for derail.
I use VLOOKUP most of the time, especially on spreadsheets that I built myself (since I set them up in the correct order). If I'm doing analysis with data from someone else, INDEX(MATCH()) saves so much time since I don't have to rearrange the sheet in the correct order. 
Thank you. 

Vlookup is easy to use and works most of the time. 

Despite having used Index Match multiple times, the correct syntax cannot stick in my mind for some reason. 

Can't even figure it out by messing around quickly. Always need to go back to some tutorial. 

I have grown to hate it... 
You're only quicker at VLOOKUP because that's what you learned first
Yeah; the app doesn't show sidebars at all, just threads.  I got "reprimanded" for my first post too :)
> that is a loaded question, um....

It really wasn't meant that way. Pretty cool stuff you are working on! :)
I mean maybe? I'm quite comfortable with both so I'm not sure that's true. It's also a smaller formula. 
This comment has been downvoted, but I don't completely disagree. Once you use index/match a lot it's only marginally slower than vlookup. 
Its for you own good ;)

Its easier to get answers to clear questions, where the first 10 questions aren't simply trying to clarify the issue - though still a big problem unfortunately.


ok :P 

Most engineers can use excel, we have to use all sorts of programs for data processing (scripting in C/C++/etc) but I use excel for quick scratch paper or for managing medium size data sets.
Alright, I'll make a different point, you'd be able to do either fast enough that the time it took to type the formula in is irrelevant
