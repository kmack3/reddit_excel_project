A good number were, but at the same time, the end user can describe their problem or suggestion better than anyone else, and their site probably got a lot of attention in terms of people who somewhat to moderately advanced features to give feedback on uservoice. 

I did appreciate that many times they discussed why a feature couldn't be implemented as a user expected, such as copy not working after modifying cells. It gave good insight to some of the challenges they are constrained by some making a product that is backwards compatible, cross platform, used on a variety of hardware in terms of speed, and used by millions of people every day
