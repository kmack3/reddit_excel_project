Question: How do I set up C column, to always reflect A minus B columns?
Put this in C1

    =A1-B1

And drag as far down as necessary.
At a previous job a boss would check excel budget grids by writing the numbers down and using a small calculator. 

Lots of fat-fingering and almost every calculation had to be cleared re-attempted. 

Now I can understand wanting to check a printed grid. But if it's open on your computer, please just ctl + click and look at the sum. 

And if you're gonna use a calculator at least make it a big one that can print. 
thank you sir
FYI this got me major brownie points with boss, as I got the answer within 10 minutes of asking him (and him not knowing either). Thanks agian.

Also, if you want to have column C permanently populate without having to use a relative formula there's a somewhat easy way to do it with VBA

Do you really think based on that question that VBA is necessary? 
"Somewhat easy" is a relative term!
Easiest goddam point ever lol
^^^vba ^^^is ^^^always ^^^necessary
I got a Cost Savings report from Ops this month that had the amount of labor time we saved on various projects and the corresponding dollar amount.  The labor+machine rate was in a cell mixed with some text, so it couldn't be referenced in a formula.  I took a closer look; all numbers were hard coded.  I think the guy used a calculator to figure out each line and then punched the numbers in by hand.
I just learned this like a month ago and I feel like a genius
Maybe epicmindwarp is OP!
Lol I guess Im just jealous Im such a noob at it...
I found it necessary to lock out my end users unless they allowed macros.
Oh. My. Fucking. God.
Take a course, once you have the basics it, gets easier to use over time. 
There's a really good VBA code repository at google.com.
I was going to ask for a link :( ....I'm dumb
