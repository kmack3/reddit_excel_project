OP is a solid mod. 
Formula for accumulation of savings based on the date.

For example, I would like a cell to display a specific amount based on the current day of the month, like a payroll. I have the increment per pay period, but not sure how to display the total accumulated on the date.

Hi! I have this task and I am looking for the fastest method to get it done. I have to make a spreadsheet list of 100 IOS application development blogs and to collect their URL, email and blogger names. What do you think? Is there a way to make it without copying them one by one?

Formula for populating various tables based upon two data points entered into a log.

My (admittedly incorrect) formula that makes sense to me logically but not to excel is: 
=IF(AND(A45:A428=C1,E45:E428=B3),C45:C428," ")

For example, This is for a fantasy baseball league.  I have 12 empty rosters that I would like to automatically populate based upon who is drafted at any given time.  I would like to enter the current draft pick into my log and assign it a spot on the roster using the team name and player position to decide which cell to populate.
Please help!
Is there a place or a format to ask very basic questions? I don't want to flood this community with dumb questions.

The downvotes speak for themselves.
It's okay I still love you
I'm sorry, I thought this post was for questions. I'll make a new post now.

I see that you get that a lot.  Sorry.  I'm new to reddit.
We let you keep your balls too.
There's quite a bit of overlap :P   
R often comes up jn threads as something to look into for "next level" stuff :) 
lol...

I suppose I could have made it more obvious that it was a joke, but that ruins the fun.
i'm sorry but /r/rlanguage may not reciprocate :)
