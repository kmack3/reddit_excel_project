On a scale of 1 to ∞, how undervalued is Excel as a skill?
I am in the process of hiring a data analyst right now. I am looking for someone that is proficient at Excel, especially in VBA. 

It's so hard to figure out who actually knows how to use it, and who says they do. Apparently every person in this day and age wants to put "proficient at Excel" when they don't even know what a SUM function is. 

So I wouldn't say Excel as a skill is undervalued, I would say that people overestimate their Excel abilities because they don't fully understand just how much Excel is capable of doing. 
I wouldn't say it's undervalued, as much as it is underestimated and not understood.

In my old job, there was a guy who could use =SUM and he was "OMG AN EXCEL WIZARD"... until they met me.

I understand what he means about the certification, but there is value to some people, not everyone.

It's something that people find difficult to learn, so they don't bother - it makes it undervalued when they don't have it - but highly valued when they finally reap the benefits from it - if that makes sense.
A scale from 1 to *infinity*?! Does not compute. 
10 billion.

I work in a fairly quantitative field, but one based in the social sciences. most of my coworkers can barely use it, and it drives me crazy, so there's that.

I also think mastery of excel represents the ability to think about problems (and solving them) from multiple perspectives, which is far more valuable than simply knowing how to use some software.
I work in a very data intensive job. What blows me away is that everyone uses excel, but no one knows how to *use* excel. Once one process is in place, it is written in stone for future generations. This was one of the processes we had to do for a time sensitive report:

* Open access db. 
* Open X table
* Copy data from x table
* Open X book
* Paste data into x book
* Repeat previous steps for Y book in the same db

I setup a basic query to the DB condensing everything down to just a "refresh" button. I'm afraid to tell my managers because I think I may have automated my job away. I am just an entry level analyst :(
[Here's a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2fec0m/help_finding_excelvba_freelanceconsultant_work/) from a little while ago where both /u/epicmindwarp and I kinda answer the question you proposed, with my answer probably being more applicable. The thing is, people don't know what Excel can do and that's a big problem when trying to market yourself, unless you're able to show them directly.
I think the biggest thing is that people don't understand the capabilities. I kind of had the same thing as /u/epicmindwarp at my current job. People had a goto excel guy who knew what =SUMIF and =COUNTIF were and he was THE GUY. I came in and opened everyone's eyes to how basic that was. I always try to make people say "Holy shit, this is excel?"
Most people know as much Excel as they need for the job, and in most cases the job doesn't really require much beyond editing text/numbers or making printouts. 
You highlight a significant problem with resumes, and claims by applicants - it's difficult to actually test their knowledge.  

This is why some people opt to go the certification route - it distinguishes them from the rest, and provides the potential employer proof that the applicant knows something (but knowing is much different than actually knowing when to use the knowledge in the proper situation).
I don't want to go too high here. Maybe 50 Million?

I was an Excel lover my whole life. Used to write complex VBA macros in middle school. Have done some add-ins, created board games, and all sorts of stuff. Being a data analyst, SQL always puts Excel in the back seat for pretty much everything except for Pivot Tables in my world now a days though.

But I will say almost no one knows how to use Excel, regardless of what their resume says. 

Some of the quarterly reports our MBA finance people put together are 10 MB disasters of cell formatting to row 1000000 and horribly constructed formulas that lock your computer up while they take 5 minutes to refresh.

Just the time wasted to manually maintain most of the spreadsheets I see is a shame. I've seen people export from our database 7-8 tabs worth of information and then do a bunch of vlookups. Next month, they reexport all of those tabs and re-make all the vlookups. 

We had a project the other day to manually map some values we had coming out of a RedCap database. People were going to do it by hand one at a time in Excel. Cringe.

If you are doing something tedious in Excel, you're using the program wrong
Excel skill is very important, yet it still does not hurts you if you are able to work with other  products as well (openoffice calc for example).

Somebody knowing most formulas off his head will certainly get a lot of work done quicker than those who do not. If you know how to write macros (or .NET integration in excel) you do repetitive tasks only once and at some point face real free time during work hours.

Does not hurt to be able to know some more exclusive features. if somebody is hiring you and you know most formulas, it is impressive.
If you are able to abuse Excel as a media player or [image rendering software](https://mega.co.nz/#F!M8gHDJBJ!1pFQ98I2J1fbgl9JSzd1xg) (both I do, yes) it gets ridiculously impressive.

What I have learned from working with products such as word and excel, **the more unproductive stuff you know, the faster you learn and adapt to productive stuff.**
How can you improve your excel skillset? I have taken countless courses and I know a lot of the capabilities of excel, but i'm sure there are a lot more. I think it's a wonderful program and would like to learn more :)
In my work Excel is critical.  I assess a variety of complex investments - distressed credit, private equity, real estate, etc.  Without Excel it would be impossible to do the analysis.  On a number of occasions Excel has been the difference between doing the deal profitably and making a loss.

If you say you know VBA that should set you apart from the =SUM crowd.  In the financial space I check whether people know IRR, XIRR, NPX, XNPV.  Can they format a table?  DO they know how to use conditional formatting?  Can they use the Solver?
This is pretty much what it's like being a musician or a photographer.
Financial accountant here.

i live on excel 
ehh, the only peopel who are really good at excel as as industry are financial analyst types .....im a data analyst and i do alot of machine learning stuff but i use excel alot for manipulation. i use vba, formulas, and lots of other cool stuff
The more you know about Excel, the more you know you don't know about Excel.  
We once hired someone at my company whose resume listed certifications in the MS Suite, as well as an MBA. In the first week of her employment, these were a few of the things I heard or witnessed firsthand.

- "You said to divide the budget by 125 to get hours, which slash in that on the keyboard?"

- "So, when you times'd those numbers, did you hit the star thing over the eight?"

- I once walked by her PC and, in the F1 search box of Excel I saw, "where is the monthly report"

So, yea, good luck out there. Some people have no shame when it comes to stone-cold lying on their resume. Also, just to close the loop on that person, we actually kept her around for about four months and she was probably making $35/hr.
I used to hire financial analysts often.  Every resume listed Excel experience or even 'Advanced Excel skills.'  Usually these new hires knew very little about actual formulas.  I ended up making my own excel test that they would take on a computer with 7 diferent situations on 7 different tabs.  It was a timed test but I told them they were free to use the internet for help (real world situation and also test problem solving ability).  Nobody got all 7 right but it did allow me to separate the wheat from the chaff.  One guy came in after and apologized for wasting my time and said he thought he knew Excel but obviously did not.  Honestly, the test was not that difficult, i.e. calc IRR, NPV, simple pivot.
In several jobs I have had the title of Excel Expert, but I feel like a novice. That program goes on for years. 
>It's so hard to figure out who actually knows how to use it, and who says they do.

One thing I learned at a previous job is that the best way to learn what somebody knows about Excel or any kind of programming is to have them show you. I can tell you that I know VBA and can write macros, but that could vary from putting "Hello World" in cell A1 to all kinds of stuff that /u/epicmindwarp does. This really goes for any coding at all. If you're able to, ask a job candidate to bring in an example of a worksheet they've created or even ask them to complete a quick task using VBA or Excel.

Another thing the recruiters did at my old job was ask people to rank themselves on a scale of 1 to 10 on how good they were with Excel. Then, the recruiters would have a list of questions that they would ask depending on the candidate's answer. If they didn't know the answer, they would go down the list, asking easier and easier questions until they found the one they could answer.

It's not a fool proof method, but it's worked pretty well in the past to get a good idea of how much people know.
See I don't put "Proficient In Excel" on my resume.  I have a projects section I use to highlight the ways I've used excel to enhance my work. If the person hiring truly needs excel experience they will know what I'm talking about.  If not I probably don't want the job anyway.
We send a prove it excel exam. That helps a ton!
Where is the job located?  I automate everything that I can.  Anything from validating orders and create input files, performing calculations and data analysis, creating emails, keying requests into IE, you name it.

Even then, I know I've only scratched the surface of what can be done with VBA.  Always new methods and techniques out there to learn.

I have been thinking that a data analyst position would be a great way to put my VBA to use.  Sounds like it could be fun and challenging.  Just haven't taken the leap yet as my current job is cake now due to getting almost all of it automated, though that does sometimes make it a tad boring.
Generally, ask them about a few functions like INDIRECT and what the limitations are (works with linking to other workbooks, but only when they're open.. otherwise #N/A), or how you'd find the last row used in VBA.

These are pretty simple for someone who uses excel function heavily on a daily basis, but someone who isn't really proficient would have no idea.

edit: just saw 2 months ago.. FML..
Your from Atlanta? I worked near Perimeter/Marietta for a week - loved it there!!
My résumé is going to read:

>**SKILLS**

>Excel- No seriously, I flipping mean it: My spreadsheets are sentient beings compared to what you're probably doing. 
Underestimated, not undervalued -- perfectly said.

I work at a major think tank; as a CPA I've also worked on the software side of several corporate accounting/finance departments.  My [very rough] Excel benchmark for people in these environments (researchers, accountants) is that they should be able to use VLOOKUP.  The reality is that 25% are real superusers, 50% are in the Excel-as-adding-machine users and the rest -- well, we have a senior person here who won't do budgets because we use Excel.  My experience is that Excel skills tend to be assumed -- but the level at which those skills are acceptable is fairly low.  As /u/epicmindwarp indicates ("... he was a ... wizard... until they met me" -- a great line!), its hard to convince people who are happy with a low skill level that they need to aim higher.

In my opinion there's a cost to not being able to use Excel at a higher level.  To give a somewhat extreme example, I was able to use Excel to pull data out of SAP and do reporting and analysis.  The cost of this was the development of a general-purpose SAP query.  Those without my Excel-ability would happily ask the SAP team to develop specialized reports and analytical tools -- at a cost that easily would have been in the six figure range.

I think you mean #N/A
I've always had people ask.. "So what else can it do?" 

To which I answer... 

>"Anything except make a sandwich"

Which is vague enough to make them come back to you with specifics, and hilarious enough to make them remember it. 
>  doesn't really require

While this is true, it doesn't mean that it's not worth learning the fancy stuff. Learning the fancy stuff is a great way to go above and beyond and attract the attention of your boss which is never a bad idea.
I've heard the certification route is mainly more appealing to the older generation who know nothing about Excel and like to see a certificate that says "This person knows Excel" rather than test the candidate themselves. Would you say that's true in your experience?
It's not stickied right now, but [this thread] was stickied and it would still be if it weren't for the new mods....

Anyways, that has lots of great resources. Also, just check /r/Excel every once in a while and look at the solved threads. You'll definitely get some good tips there.
Making those who realize the breadth and depth of functionality underestimate their abilities while those who don't to put down "proficient"
You guys hiring? LOL. 
I remember your post from another thread, it made me burst out laughing! Yeah, definitely left a scar in my mind. 

$35 an hour? 

Now I've burst into tears...
> "times'd"

I lost it.
Would you please post your test? I'm always looking to improve my Excel skills.
Thanks! I actually have some interviewers coming in this week. I was just going to ask them to complete a quick task using VBA that they would need to know how to do anyway. 

Asking them to rank themselves on a scale of 1-10 is a GREAT idea! I'm going to be taking a leaf from that book. Midevil you da real hero <3
This is great, however, I'm obviously identifying the wrong jobs. I wish I could get to an interview to show case my projects, however, I only get scripted phone interviews. As another poster said, I probably don't want those jobs...
Atlanta, GA :) PM me if you are local, unfortunately we are not offering relo right now.
Yes I am! I live right by Perimeter, actually. The suburbs are really nice. Let me know if you ever come back! :) 
>-	Design and support Excel VBA macros and queries to interpret and manipulate large datasets
>-	Create and develop processes by utilising Office based tools such as macros, pivot tables, and basic SQL

Actual extracts from mine.
I feel like this would be good:

> **Excel**  
I created this and use it all the time: =RAND()<(($A$1-COUNTIF($A$1:$A1,TRUE))/COUNTA(INDIRECT(CONCATENATE("B",ROW(B2),":B$",COUNTA(B:B)))))
Beast.
I'm a CPA, but in industry. I would love to have 25% superusers.  The CFO and I are the only two in our company, but he doesn't know much vba. And God forbid you try to teach someone keyboard shortcuts. 
The cost is very true.

Just 3 months ago, I got someone accidentally made redundant because I replaced his job with an 80 line macro....
I say "Anything but cook you dinner."
But again, most jobs don't require the fancy stuff, and the boss might not be that impressed that you can do something that's not really going to help you work. The boss of a saleschimp would be more impressed by someone who doesn't use Excel well, but has the sales and people skills to outsell the guy who's an excel wizz but barely makes quota. 

Some managers might even feel threatened if they think you know something better than they do. 
Honestly, the interviews that mention it say something like, 

* "On a scale of 1-10 rate your Excel skills",
* "What are your most frequently used formulas",
* "Do you know Excel"


Our HR is old. He was very excited to see certifications plastered at the top of the resume, lol. That person became our first interviewer. 
Yes, just one question. Do you know all the keyboard slashes?
Hmm. I make around $40 an hour in my budget reporting job. Australia though and I do know excel. Im probably the most proficient in head office.

I'm developing a training set and to deliver some training sessions to change this.
multiply...product...math is hard.
I'm not snuka, but for my current test I'm having them: Perform a vlookup or index match with data from another workbook nested in an IF function, and write a simple macro with a for loop that looks through data from each row and puts those rows into another spreadsheet.
Sorry, that was two jobs and 6 years ago.  I really don't think I have it anymore. 
Awww, shanks. :)

Lemme know if you need ideas for questions or want to run them by someone. 
Like the other guy said, the more you know about excel, the more you don't know about excel

I've been working as a data analyst for six years, and I know a bit, but man, I know enough to know that in comparison to the gurus, I'm like...a 4.
Dang.  KC here.  Was worth a shot at least.

Could you possibly say what the pay range would be for an entry level data analyst with demonstrable skills?  I'm curious how worthwhile it'd be to pursue.  Feel free to PM if you don't want to say in chat.
Where in Atlanta? Lol. I'm north of the city... not sure I'm looking to make a change but potential options could be interesting.
Must... resist... urge to copy and paste...
These are good because Excel is a tool - a means to an end. But not an end in itself. I don't really care what tool someone uses as long as they solve the problem efficiently.

 I like how you focus on what you can do rather than just listing a bunch of formula names like I see on most resumes.
This is much better than what I have listed.  I'm going to paraphrase what you have here, and update mine.  Thanks - seriously.

Currently I list "developing XX automated Excel-based tools", etc and in skills I list that I'm proficient in VBA (I'm an analyst, but worked full time for awhile developing VBA-based tools for our central org).  


Brilliant. This is the difference between the person who uses excel casually and the person who uses excel for the black magic monster that it can be. 

As a hiring manager, if I was looking for someone to work with data and it had to involve xlsx files, I would call you for an interview ASAP. 

As for OPs question, I would say that the thing to look for is whether or not they list VBA, not so much excel. 
What on earth does that do.
=INDEX(OFFSET($A$1,0,0,COUNTA($A:$A),1),RANDBETWEEN(1,COUNTA($A:$A)),1)
I found the hardest part was teaching someone how to structure their tables and data correctly. It was pulling teeth at points to get that idea in their head, and now they love that you just have to write a formula to figure stuff out.
Your comment in a previous thread has made me 10x more diligent in password protecting some of my spreadsheets ... in the event that I macro myself out of a job.

And I will never ever give away my personal.xlsx >_>
Watch out: with great power and an 80 line macro comes great responsibility
Right, I totally agree. It's only really beneficial if it helps you do your job better. Otherwise, it's just a waste of time in your boss's eyes and actually hurts you rather than helps.
The first and the third questions are very subjective, which is problematic. And the second one is rather misleading, because honestly, the formulas I truly use most are VLOOKUP, SUMIF, and COUNTA which really aren't super advanced and don't demonstrate my skills accurately. 
Haha I've figured as much. I was thinking about getting some kind of certification, but I've decided not to. Not worth the time/effort.
>  Do you know all the keyboard slashes

Ha!!!

Total trick question... everybody knows that Slash plays guitar, not keyboard.



uh, i put down an answer but the computer says you have network connectivity problems

Forward or back?


So based on that, VBA is valued pretty highly... I consider myself very skilled in excel (nobody in my office is even in the same universe as I am, I realize that's not necessarily saying much), but I'm weak in VBA. Granted I can record a macro for the most part, if it's doing something relatively straightforward.

My question then is, is there a good way to start learning VBA? I have no coding background but I work in SQL frequently (again, I can write some scripts but I'm by no means "proficient") so I'm familiar with structured language. I really want to take my skills to the next level.
Your test is more difficult than mine was.  What is your success rate?
Would there be bonus points for loading the data into an array and using Range.Resize to output it? :)
Compared to even the people on this forum, I'm #1!!!! 


out of 10, with 10 being the best. 
I'm deadly curious too. I think the market out here may be underpaying.
Your from Atlanta? I worked for a week near the Marietta/Perimeter area. Loved it there!! 
If you pay me loyalties, you can have it ;D
Thanks, putting formulae is meaningless because they'll look and go "okay"

My keywords allow the interviewer to ask more, and then I get to talk about the real hardcore stuff, based on what I have already learnt from the interviewer. So, I can put VLOOKUP on the CV, and they'll be like "Yes that'll work" and not enquire any further. But if I dont put it on the CV, when they ask me, I can talk about VBA/Macros and [do this.](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NcpapFpuMW8/URAC-sidZuI/AAAAAAAAAB0/auTRQvHhCTU/s1600/Mind-Blown.jpg)
You owe it to iEuphoria for the rights to use my words (he gave me gold ;) )
I tend to give examples with a very quick overview of the details so they know I'm not just chatting bull. It works :D
Have a list of things that you need to select a random set of X out of? Insert a column at A, put X in A1, and paste this formula in A2. Copy down, you'll have X TRUEs, and the rest will be FALSEs. We have to audit random sets of data, and this was a godsend when I thought of it one day in the bathroom.
Dude, this is why I encrypt everything  by changing the font color to white.
Totally agree.  My most used is a nested Index/Match, and GetPivotData.
Yes! Check out the books by John Walkenbach. "Power Programming" and his "VBA for Dummies" come highly recommended. 

SQL is great. Its easy until it gets hard, haha but it does such a wide variety of things. 
That's harder??? How easy was your test?
100%! ..... Only one interviewed so far.
Loyalties given =) 
ha, noted.  Maybe he'll let it slide since I was helping him with something earlier this week.
>  I thought of it one day in the bathroom.

Where all good thinking gets done.
¯\\_(◔ ‿ ◔)_/¯
Ok I'll look into those. The biggest problem I have right now is that I've become so known for my reports that I have an ever increasing workload so I feel like I never have any time to develop my skills unless I'm putting something together for someone. And generally that's on a timeline so I do it the way I know works and get it done. Thanks! I really want to boost my resume so I can actually take it in and say "this is why I need a raise" haha
To you it would be quite easy but I don't imagine any of my candidates subscribed to the subreddit ;)
Hahahaha! Thanks!!

If you want, paste some of your resume/CV here and I can make... "ammendments"
Of course! This sub is awesome, I love the wonderful people here. 

EDIT: And thanks for the help Tally :) 

EDIT2: I'm a she btw, not that it matters
Yeah I feel you. Stalking this subreddit has helped me a lot, and also just reading books by John Walkenbach whenever I have the time. I take a few courses on www.coursera.com as well, such as Data Scientist's Toolbox series by John Hopkins and also Programming in R. 
My bad.  Added a tag next to your name so I don't forget in the future :)
I do love this sub. This and Chandoo have helped me out on a few things, usually VBA related. Unfortunately, if I can't figure out how to do it, it's usually REALLY complicated and I've run into problems that can't actually be completed the way I want them to. I have occasionally had to use interim steps to get the end result I want.
This makes me even more nervous O_O

Am I tagged as "SheExcelStalker"? 
Beginners should really check out Walkenbach's "VBA for Dummies".  We all start somewhere.  Since you have a background with other languages you should be able to pick it up fairly easy.

I'd say the most difficult thing about VBA, especially once you push it out to end-users, is determining all the edge cases.

Pro-tip: Use "Option Explicit" at the top of every module (there's actually an option an IDE to set this by default), and use static typing.  Helps debugging, and your sanity in larger applications.
Ha, no.  "It's a she". Verbatim.
