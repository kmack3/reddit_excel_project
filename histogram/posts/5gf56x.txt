How to make art with Microsoft excel
I was expecting something about using cells as pixels, as we've seen before, but this is truly bizarre. I mean, if you're going to use MS Office as a drawing platform, why not do this in PowerPoint, which exposes additional tools? Or is the real purpose to show how much overlap there is in these products?  Or is it to show how much extra functionality exists in there that you never use? 


That was fascinating!  Thanks for sharing!
Amazing. 
crazy
It sounds like the original artist chose Excel kind of incidentally rather than as a deliberate choice from among Office products.

I'm curious, though - what other tools does PPT have that are missing in Excel? I've done very little by way of graphics in either so I'm unfamiliar with those tools.
[from what I can tell](http://www.businessinsider.com/tatsuo-horiuchi-excel-art-2014-6?op=1&IR=T/#saw-other-people-neatly-drawing-graphs-and-i-thought-it-seemed-like-excel-could-be-used-to-draw-art-he-told-pc-online-3) He saw people at work creating graphs etc. With excel and became inspired. Had an idea and pursued it
He didn't want to spend the money on drawing software and as most computers have excel he started there. 

All of that in his golden years too. Pretty impressive to someone like me who still gets confused with the if function. 
You can deform preset shapes point by point, and the newest versions of PPT (I think starting on 2013) allow you to combine shapes into new shapes (union, substract, intersect, etc)
