How to sum depending on date
If the date in question is in A1 and your monthly budget is in B1, this formula: 

    =(B1/DAY(EOMONTH(A1,0)))*DAY(A1)

Should be what you're looking for. If the cell gives a date as an answer (e.g. 1/5/1900), make sure the cell is formatted as a number. 
So i've done: 

=(B31/31)*DAY(TODAY())

B31 is the cell that says Â£160 in. Does that look reasonable?
Hi,

Try

=DAY(TODAY())*5
Winner, thanks! Came up with a different result that what I posted but it looks more accurate! Cheers
