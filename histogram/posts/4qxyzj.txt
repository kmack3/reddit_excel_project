How do I create a floating table?
I believe you should be able to use the camera tool in excel. You would have your actual table on another sheet, but the camera view of the table. could be with your charts.

Coming back to this is there a way to make a floating table that I can later edit or will I need to always take a picture of the table and add it in?

The camera tool will always display the current values of the range you chose. You will need to manually edit the range if the range changes (or use a macro).
Boom in all my years of excel use I have never used the camera function. This is awesome thank you guys and gals.

Camera is a weird gadget that has never made it to the main toolbar, yet it's been around for years. So handy though! 
I never use it as I have no real use for it, the dashboards and reports I typically build are printed one-pagers. And anything that needs to be beyond a page are detailed reporting for actionable items.

There are small parts of Excel that come and go, that people tend to miss. For example, select visible cells is now buried but still there; but object selection is now worse than in 2003.
