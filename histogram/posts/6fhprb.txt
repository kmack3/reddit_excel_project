How do I calculator time worked, with a start and end time, minus a value (30 to 90) for a lunch break? (Without needing to know when a break started or ended; only needing to know how long it was).
Excel handles time in fractions of days. For example, 12pm is ".5"

This is because, under the formatting, excel handles dates as "the number of days since Jan 0, 1900" (yes, 0, that's not a typo)

So, 12pm June 5th 2017 is "42891.5"

Knowing this, if you have the lunch duration in minutes, you can do TimeOut - Time In - [lunch duration in minutes]/60/24

Edit: alternatively, you can use the excel TIME(h,m,s) function you do the calculation for you. You could then do, assuming your column label is A1 and lunch duration is in minutes, "A3 - A2 - TIME(0, A4, 0)"
