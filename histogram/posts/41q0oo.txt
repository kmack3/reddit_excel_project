How to get rid of extra spaces??
Use the trim function.

    =TRIM(Address Cell)

e.g. 

    =TRIM(A2)

After that, copy/paste special>Values
>     Sub DeleteLeadingTrailingSpaces()
>       For Each cell In Selection
>       On Error Resume Next
>         cell.Value = Trim(cell.Value)
>       Next
>     End Sub
If they have the same number of spaces afterwards, you can cntrl-f, then replace, and search for that many spaces and replace with no spaces -
As others have said, =TRIM() is the function you most likely want here. What it does is removes leading and trailing spaces from text. It also replaces any double spaces between words with a single space. Depending on what you are doing with the addresses, you might also want to do an =PROPER() which changes the first letter of each word to caps and all others to lowercase. Useful if you have addresses that are all caps or all lower or some mix and you intend to use them to create mailers.
Ctrl-H

Find find and replace all

Also works for whatever devil form of spaces come from data copied from other programs into excel with spaces but you have to copy the " " and paste that

Do I have to do a =TRIM for each cell?

CLEAN is used for clearing out non-printable characters, not spaces.

TRIM can remove extra spaces at any point of a string.
Yes. Put the formula in an empty column. Copy, select all 10,000 rows in that column and paste.
thanks
