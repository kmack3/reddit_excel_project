Let's all share our useful macros / spreadsheets!
Mine is simple but I use it every day. I recorded a macro for ctrl-d to do Paste Special/Values.
I'll share three simple macros: 

1] A macro to list worksheets and worksheet colours in a "HowTo" worksheet

      Sub SheetNamesAndColours()
        Worksheets("HowTo").Select
        For i = 2 To Sheets.Count
          Range("A1").Offset(i - 1, 0).Value = Sheets(i).Name
          Range("A1").Offset(i - 1, 0).Interior.Color = Sheets(i).Tab.Color
       Next i
      End Sub

2] A macro to automatically format my pivot tables with the format I almost always use ("database" style), and which converts "Sum of Field1" in "Field1 " for clarity.

    Sub UpdatePivotTable()
    ' Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+u

    Application.ScreenUpdating = False

    With ActiveCell.PivotTable   
        .RowAxisLayout xlTabularRow
        .RepeatAllLabels xlRepeatLabels
        .ColumnGrand = False
        .RowGrand = False
        .HasAutoFormat = False
        .DisplayContextTooltips = False
        .ShowDrillIndicators = False
        .TableStyle2 = "PivotStyleMedium9"
    End With
    
    On Error Resume Next
      For Each pf In ActiveCell.PivotTable.PivotFields
        pf.Subtotals(1) = True
        pf.Subtotals(1) = False
      Next pf
    
      For Each pf In ActiveCell.PivotTable.DataFields
        If (Left(pf.Caption, 6) = "Sum of" Or Left(pf.Caption, 10) = "Average of") Then
            pf.Caption = pf.SourceName & " "
        End If
      Next pf
  
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    
    End Sub

3] And finally, a macro which automatically inserts these bloody =index(column2,match(value,column1,0)). I select 4 cells with ctrl+click: the first one is the destination cell for the formula, the second one the value to search, third one is the top cell of column1, and fourth one is the top cell of column 2. Once the cells are selected, I press ctrl+q. It saves me so much time!!

    Sub InsertIndexMatch()
    ' Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl+q    
    Dim rngDataCell As Range
    Dim rngIndexArray As Range
    Dim rngIndexRange As Range
    Dim rngFormula As Range
    
    Dim strDataCell As String
    Dim strIndexArray As String
    Dim strIndexRange As String
    
    If Selection.Areas.Count <> 4 Then
        MsgBox "Select 4 cells first"
    Else
        Set rngDataCell = Selection.Areas(2)
        Set rngIndexRange = Selection.Areas(3)
        Set rngIndexArray = Selection.Areas(4)
        Set rngFormula = Selection.Areas(1)
        
        Set rngIndexRange = Range(rngIndexRange, rngIndexRange.End(xlDown))
        Set rngIndexArray = Range(rngIndexArray, rngIndexArray.End(xlDown))
        
        strDataCell = rngDataCell.Address(0, 1, , True)
        strIndexArray = rngIndexArray.Address(1, 0, , True)
        strIndexRange = rngIndexRange.Address(1, 1, , True)
        
        rngFormula.Formula = "=INDEX(" & strIndexArray & ",MATCH(" & _
        strDataCell & "," & strIndexRange & ",0))"
        
        rngFormula.Select
    End If
    
    End Sub


I used Snippet Manager (http://www.snippetmanager.net/) to store the useful macros or wrappers that I write. That way instead of re-writing or reinventing the wheel each time, I simply paste the snippet in.

Place the Snippet Manager folder inside a DropBox folder and you now have a synchronized snippet collection anywhere!
Here's a simple one I use pretty often.  Say you have a column of information, names, cities, etc... Click on the top item in that column (not the header) - and run this macro.  

[CountUniques.xlsm](http://www.sendspace.com/file/upbtmt) - make sure you click "Click here to start download from sendspace"

It will insert two new columns to the right with the unique items and their counts. I have this saved on my Quick Access toolbar, so it's easy to run quickly.

Click on the top item in the Count column (not the header) and run it again, and it will give you a distribution of how many times each frequency appears.  So 5 things are listed 1 time, 10 things are listed twice, etc...

I guess it depends on what you need to figure out, but I use it pretty frequently!
A good idea, but then don't you lose the Fill-Down feature of CTRL+D? For paste special I use ALT, E, S, V, ENTER.
Hah! Me too.
I have a similarly simple macro that saves a backup of my file (with date / time in the filename) to a specific folder.

Helpful when I'm working on an intense model and want to be able to revert back to an old version (or for error-checking).
I really like that third one!

Love innovative ways of making things easier.
Along similar lines I use [MZTools](http://www.mztools.com/v3/mztools3.aspx) a lot when writing VBA class modules.  
I double click to fill down.
Same, it takes less than a second to do it once you get used to it. 
In fact I had to look down to see what I was pressing since I just do it out of memory, haha
