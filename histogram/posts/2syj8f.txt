F4 Key - Repeat Last Action
> I know most people probably know about the F4 key for repeat last action

A lot of people don't - so thank you.
Ctrl+Y is slightly different. Sometimes you can redo once with F4, when you could have repeated multiple times with Ctrl+Y. Ctrl+Y is also more consistent across programs.

In any case it's a great tip, thanks for sharing.
I teach this to everyone I work with.  It is such a time saver for me. 
In-formula, it also toggles absolute/relative referencing.
I didn't. Thanks!
Ctrl+y is just to redo undo isn't it? I am a little confused.
Since writing this I've been trying to remember an example of where you can redo only once with F4 when you could have repeated multiple times with Ctrl+Y, and not remembered any. If any else can think of an example, please remind me!

The more I think about it, it may have been a temporary minor bug which has since been fixed, or perhaps I imagined it in the first place.
I just tested, and apparently it does both. It *seems* like it always does "redo" if it can, and "repeat last action" otherwise. But it's definitely been the shortcut for "redo" in Microsoft applications for pretty much forever.
That's right, thanks tf113
