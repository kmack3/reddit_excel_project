How to: VLOOKUP alternative with multiple criterias using INDEX and MATCH
nice post! 

Another way of doing the same thing is to do MATCH(criteria1&criteria2,criteria_range1&criteria_range2,0). That can cause issues if you have numerical values though (1 and 10 being the same as 11 and 0..)

If you have unique combinations, you could also use INDEX(C2:C8,SUMPRODUCT(ROW(C1:C7)*(A2:A8="Apple")*(B2;B8="United Kingdom"))) 

but evaluating each criteria range individually and matching is probably the most generally applicable and easily readable. 

Concepts of what's going on should be familiar after reading your  post! :D
An excellent post! This is a very nice way of returning a text value.

For a number this would be an alternative (based on the same principles):
=SUMPRODUCT(--($A$13:$A$19="Apple")*--($B$13:$B$19="United Kingdom")*$C$13:$C$19)
Awesome. TLDR: Learn what a VLOOKUP does, then never use it again.
Love those kind of posts. Awesome work dude
A multi-criteria VLOOKUP is also pretty easy:

Array would have to be 1D. Alternative: use INDEX's 3rd argument to specify column index for its 1st argument Array.

There could be multiple matches for the criteria, so this can be generalized as

    =INDEX(Array,SMALL(IF((criteria1)*...*(criteriaN),ROW(Array)-MIN(ROW(Array))+1),instance),column)
You are my hero
I had a problem a few weeks ago that could have been cleanly solved with this! Thank you so much for sharing :)
I always use Index(Match,Match).    

INDEX(ARRAY,MATCH(VALUE,RANGE,0),MATCH(VALUE,HEADING_RANGE,0))

Second Match being the headings of the column I want returned.  99% of the time I'm using structured ranges from ACCESS, but works even if normal range.
Im a big fan of the sumproduct(row()) structure as it allows for more versatility than the match, - for example you can use it to check if a value is in another list (i.e. multiple acceptable values) by nesting an isnumber( match()) 

but more importantly the sumproduct cant be easily broken by end users who dont understand / expect array formula.

bonus point: because sumproduct isnt an array formula if you use the function wizard to investigate the formula you can see the internal arrays its using which is handy for debugging. 
Yes, but look at how much OP wrote about simple ol' Index and Match... Do you really want to explain these two approaches?
You can add a separator between the concatenates to prevent number issues being a problem. I use this approach by setting up a helper column - makes it much easier to follow than an array formula.
Index/Match is generally faster and more versatile than V/HLookup. There are some instances where it's not faster, but it's generally a better idea to use index/match.
