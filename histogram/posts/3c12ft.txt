A diet spreadsheet I made.. it's pretty advanced compared to some others I've seen.
Flair changed to pro tip.

I might add this to our new and upcoming templates section (see above green flashy link).
Suggestion: How about a conversion chart for those of us that use the metric system?

Cool sheet, thanks for sharing. Another idea for macronutrients would be to use g/kg or g/lb when allocating P/C/F, as %'s tend to vary especially as calories go down or up depending on the diet goals. Another option is to create a sheet where calories and BW (from your weigh-ins) are inputted and then plotted on a chart to see trends.

Yeah feel free. Like I said, you guys can supercharge it into something beautiful :)
I guess something like that could go on the front page..
Whilst I do love graphs, that'd require and entirely new functionality for this spreadsheet, such as tracking weight, which is not its purpose. Whilst I'm all for increasing versatility, I think that is something best handled by a dedicated spreadsheet. (There's TDEE one already on /r/fitness).
