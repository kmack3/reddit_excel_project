Best on-screen fonts for Excel?
I usually stick to Calibri.

However, Comic Sans and Wing Dings are always good to frustrate your co-workers!
I cant stand anything but calibri 
Arial 10pt. Calibri is like poison to my soul.
I love Leelawadee. Looks nice and very legible, plus it has a fun name. Like you say though, it's very subjective.
Microsoft YaHei is solid. Tahoma and Verdana have good legible numbers.
Noto sans (free Google font)
My company's brand guidelines state 10pt Trebuchet, which I think is fine. But I usually just leave it on Calibri.
Calibri size 11.
I like Twentieth Century MT, has a kind of cool art deco feel...but I only use it sparingly at work 
Segou UI, size 9
Wingdings 
Jokerman.
Taste is not subjective!
Is that what they teach you in clown college?
You don't use it?  What do you use, Cooper Black?  Algerian?
