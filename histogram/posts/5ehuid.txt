So close to Thanksgiving Day, I'd like to give a shout-out to this sub. Thanks /r/Excel!
Thanks to this great community who is always willing to help out with the most minor of issues.

Respectful, detailed explanations. Great people. Thanks all!
But Thanksgiving isn't for another 11 months? 

Just kidding, and I agree this sub is great!
We love to help and everyone here responds in a warm and friendly manner, that's why we're here and will continue to be here. 

Happy Thanksgiving to those who celebrate it. 
This sub has helped me more times than I care to remember. Happy thanksgiving r/excel!
I'm a pretty new subscriber and have only been a 'giver' not a 'taker' but I help because I can and also because geeks like showing off.
