Looking for a good excel certification to boost my resume.
Microsoft still offers certification.  It is now known as the Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS).  It has 3 levels, standard, expert, and master,
I'm not sure what it's like.  I received the predecessor of the MOS called the MOUS (Microsoft Office User Specialist) and I honestly expected it to be much harder.  It had 2 levels, standard and expert.
Usually the best certification is just experience. I work in financial modelling and I've never heard of anyone getting any sort of 'official' certification for their Excel skills. People just highlight projects they've worked on in their CV. 

Point being: not many people have really heard of Excel certifications (at least in the financial modelling team I've worked in or modelling heavy job interviews I've gone to not once has any certification been mentioned) and as such I'm not sure that doing one would really boost your CV if nobody recognizes it. 
If I'm looking to learn more about excel would a study guide like the one linked by OP be a good resource? Or what would be a good resource to learn generally about excel other than experience?
Good the link I provided is basically a study guide for the MOS so it sounds like a good option!
MOS was pretty easy to be honest but I think it's a decent one to prove you've got a relatively decent level of Excel skill.
How do you highlight the projects on a cv?
I've got the master certification for office.

Not many people know what it is, so I found it seems more impressive on my CV.

They're a piece of piss to do as well
