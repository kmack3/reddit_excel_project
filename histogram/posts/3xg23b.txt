Hey, I see you missed a few posts, I can help with that! (2015-12-19)
A lot of these are labeled "Waiting on OP", They already have an answer :-/
Often there's only very few cases in a week with no responses at all (some weeks we have none at all!) 

So we decided to include posts with only 1 reply as well, in case someone wanted to have a look and could maybe come up with a different solution. 

I used to do the report manually and I'd sort of skim through them and exclude posts where there was a good answer but OP never came back, alas, I'm no-where near as consistent as the bot in getting stuff done early saturday morning :D
