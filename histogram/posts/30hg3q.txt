Just a reminder, Cal Poly Pomona's MOOC: Intro To Excel VBA Programming, starts next week! Link Inside.
Great! Thanks for the reminder, I know a lot of people have responded to this every time it's come up, hopefully they won't miss it. 

Also changed flair from unsolved to advertisement. 
The professor of the class released the materials for week 1 last week (or the week before?).


As he said, the class is designed for people completely new to Excel, so those materials were very basic and took me perhaps 90 minutes to fly through everything.  Just FYI if anyone wants to get a head start!
RemindMe! 4 days "vba"

I'm back and forth on this (infant and new job limits free time). What are the advantages of VBA if I am already reasonably skilled at excel? I am an analyst, but most everything seems to be worked with a pivot or a few nested ifs

All their lessons are on youtube and are available to everyone, only the quizzes/tests are limited to people enrolled in the class
As with most things, it really depends on what your aspirations are.  Most bonafide analysts are well-versed in VBA.  For data modeling and automation, there just isn't a better alternative within the MS Office Universe.  I'm a data analyst for a large financial institution and I find myself using VBA, C#, and Python quite a bit.  If all you're doing is data entry or simple formulas from within the datasheet, you may not need VBA.  However, if you ever plan on being a higher level analyst, it's almost a necessity.
I'm in almost the exact same boat as you, but I did sign up for the class because there are no drawbacks or costs. I plan of putting in a little time and seeing if it is worth it.
I realize I didn't give you any examples.  Some things I may use VBA for within excel:

- creating data models to clean up sloppy data entry for analytics.

- automating refreshes, creating external connections on the fly

- creating dashboards to display information to those users who don't handle pivot results very well.

- automation of repetitive formatting tasks in templates.  

- the list goes on.  It's a real useful tool and a great skill to be able to put on a resume.  It also introduces you into the fundamentals of programing and logical thinking.
