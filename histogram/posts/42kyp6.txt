Found a way to disable those pesky Excel 2013 animations. A real life saver!!
You can try disable Hardware Acceleration.

Goto: Options > Advanced > Disable Hardware Graphics acceleration. 

No registry change. 
Silly question, here.  What animations are we talking about?
hmmmmm....did you actually look to see if that check box is there? Cause it isn't....it was only in the beta version
There are a lot of transition animations like when you highlight a range or fill data. Instead of instant changes Excel will show your selections shrinking or growing and numbers "roll round" when they calculate.  It's quite irritating at first but you get used to it
maybe its the startup animation? because I dont see any animation in-app lol
Interesting, I seem to have it.

I'll do some research, but looks like there is a way to do it without registry edits.
I never found it irritating, but since I'm running sometimes 10 spreadsheets at a time (each with 15-20 tabs), these animations can really slow excel down. When I'm using my home computer, it doesn't matter, because I don't run as much stuff at once.

EDIT: I guess excel slowing down is irritating, so yeah...it's irritating. But I don't find it irritating because of the aesthetics, just the extra toll they can take on the computer.
Either way, if it works, it's not poor advice. Poor advice is when it doesn't work.
That's what I meant by irritating. Not so much slowing down the machine but all those split second wait times bugged me when I first upgraded
Ok, I've put it back up.
