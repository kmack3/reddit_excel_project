Game for Excel Keyboard Shortcuts
This... is quite interesting.

(Disclaimer: not advocating, just saying it looks intriguing)
This is awesome, thank you! Bookmared. 
Great! Thanks.
I only did the formatting one but I liked it.  The alt+' didn't register correctly, and the "too slow" either needs to give you more time or should be removed.    I found little value a lot of the short cuts provided, but am thinking that's because I was on the formatting chapter or whatever.  Cool stuff; excel short cuts are important.
Neat!
I'd suggest that adding an illustration of what the shortcut does would be useful in the 'Learn' section.

For example, I don't know off the top of my head what the Format Style dialog box looks like at all, so it's tricky to anchor it to a shortcut in my head.

It doesn't matter when simply learning by rote but it would be useful for those of us who want to link concepts to 'images' (for want of a better term) of what they do.

Also, I got three things right in training in 5 seconds and it starts asking me to sign up - I really don't want to give you my email address, but now all I can do is either go to Test or go back to Dojo. How come I'm not allowed to continue in 'Learn' anymore? 

Otherwise neat concept.
Alt+' is a shortcut from excel 2003 that doesn't work in later versions. That might be why there was a problem
