Is there a way that I can plot a chart like this on excel?
[Yup, a 2D area chart](http://i.imgur.com/GdB69hd.png). You can then [adjust the transparency on your data](http://i.imgur.com/udDESMl.png).
Hey thanks for your answer. My question however was regarding the transparency. Is there a way that I can make them transparent and display another color where they mix?
Sorry, I just did a ninja edit there in case that's what you were asking about. Select your data on the chart, go to Format Data Series, and transparency is in there. My screenshot above is for 2013, so it's different in other versions, so if it's 2010 or earlier it's in the Chart design (?) tab.

WOW I've been banging my head against the wall for a while on this one! Thanks a lot!
