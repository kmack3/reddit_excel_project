How to add tick and tie out marks?
Not excel related, but trying to change excel on a small old (what I can only assume is an) audit firm. 

Good Luck

Thank you! I'll read through it this morning.  The coding looks manageable but I take it, I'll have to customize to my needs with the tick marks?
Indeed, the instructions are mostly to outline how to go about adding a new custom button to the form. You could then have it pop up a form to choose which symbols to add, or have it be a single button to character relationship.
Hmm. I just started reading through (I am a super programming noob) and I guess it requires me to actually use MS Project 2010 to create the ribbon in Excel huh? Unfortunately, I don't have access to that software at work.  Just want to confirm, so I can mark my post as solved.  You've been very helpful!

You have me curious about tinkering with custom add-ins now.

I think this is just what I'm looking for.  Thanks again!
