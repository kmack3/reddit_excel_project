Back to Basics: Excel Core Concepts
Added to the sidebar.
this should be stickied in the sidebar. this is the sort of post that really helps completely new users. this would have been a great thing to have all in one post when I first started using excel for real shit. 
Well done OP. 
Thanks for referencing my site Excel Exposure, and posting all this great information here!

Glad to hear that people are finding the site to be useful!
Best guide..short and simple
one for the wiki , good job OP
Upvoted for Vlookup master race
This is beautiful! Excellent work!
Nice job! Didn't skim all of it but looks well written, well organized, and well thought out.

One note, from the "What's a spreadsheet made of?" section:

> A1:C4 represents the rectangular range of cells from A1 through D6

D6? :P
Hi, Awesome write-up.  I'll read it over more later but quickly skimming I saw a minor error

> $ before the column letter or row number [6], so that the column/row of that reference doesn't change when the cell is copied. So D10 =$D8+D$9 copied to E15 will be =$**D13**+E$9

Should be $D8 for this absolute example.  

Sweet looking guide though from what I've skimmed. 


This is wonderful! Thanks for taking the time and care to post this well-written primer!
I'd give you gold if I could. Thanks!
Great Job, OP! I am new to Excel and this post has come as a much needed gift to me. I can't thank you enough for this!
Ha, nice catch. I'll fix that when I'm at a PC. Much appreciated! 
Thanks for the kind words, and I appreciate the feedback! I double-checked this just now and I'm still seeing what I wrote in the post. Perhaps you read $D$8 rather than $D8, or didn't notice that I copied the cell a few rows down as well as over a column? I meant to use two terms with either column or row anchored to succinctly illustrate the feature without having to give an example that is fully anchored.
You're quite welcome! 
Whoops, sorry about that, I swear I'm dyslexic sometimes.  I saw the $ in different places.  Again, great write up haha
