Request for an example workbook showing commonly used formulas, functions and techniques
The link below contains a spreadsheet with over 150 example functions/formulas.  It's 10 years old now but is still relevant.  I think this is the one you are talking about.

http://chandoo.org/wp/ this one is kind of blatant, but the examples are low level enough to help.
Thanks for that, it wasn't the one I remember but it's certainly comprehensive. This one has about 20 or so tabs and covered the more widely used formulas like sum, v and h lookups etc. Thanks again. 
That spreadsheet is awesome. Thanks!
