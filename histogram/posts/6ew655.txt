Using Indirect in reference to another sheet
Use a text merge within your indirect to keep CalulationSheet! in there after it resolves:

=INDIRECT("CalculationSheet!"&CalculationSheet!B3)

This is correct -- alternatively, change the string in CalculationSheet from "N2" to "CalculationSheet!N2" .

When Indirect receives the N2 reference, it's assuming you mean the current sheet unless you tell it otherwise.
