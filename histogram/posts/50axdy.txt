Financial Formulas
a) PMT function

Note that since our periods our monthly, we'll need to divide the interest rate by 12. We will have 60 periods (5 * 12). Our starting value is negative, since it's an amount owed. Overall formula:

    =PMT(5.5%/12,5*12,-45000)

b) FV function

We don't know if periods are yearly or not, so will assume regular 7% rate and 15 periods. I'll assume this an investment, so we are not paying down a loan. In that case, pmt needs to be negative. Overall formula:

    =FV(7%, 15, -250)

c) PV function

Similar to b for the Rate and periods. We have no pmt amount. Present value is positive, which is the opposite of a loan, so fv is negative. Overall formula

    =PV(15%,3,0,-56000)

In summary, I'm guessing you were getting tripped up between when formulas are expecting a negative value or not. Comes up a lot because many times you're dealing with loans, where value is actually negative vs. a payment is positive. Difference in how you see credits vs. debits, really. Hope this helps!
