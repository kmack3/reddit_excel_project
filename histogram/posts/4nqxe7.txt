Using countifs with multiple criteria
I would probably just add in a dummy column in column E with the formula 

    = IF ( C4 = D4 , TRUE, IF ( AND ( OR ( C4 = "Mobile", C4 = "Sales"), OR ( D4 = "Mobile", D4 = "Sales")), TRUE , FALSE ))

Then do a countif for the trues in F5:

    = COUNTIF ( E:E , TRUE)
Thanks for your reply.  That sounds like the most simplistic way.

Cool!
