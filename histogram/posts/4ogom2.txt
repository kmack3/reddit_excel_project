I found a way to place cell content in print headers including pictures, without VBA
This is a good way to get headers repeated across the top of every page when printing.

I used to have a client that used to put headers every X rows so it would print properly. Causes so many problems later down the line!
I admit it, I did not know about it.

But I'll gladly steal your idea! BWHAHA!!!
