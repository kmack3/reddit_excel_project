Having stock prices update automatically in excel 2016?
Try these two links:

http://www.excel-university.com/msn-moneycentral-iqy-web-query/

http://www.stockkevin.com/2013/03/how-to-pull-stock-quotes-into-excel.html

First one has a download link to the .IQY files required for the second one.
I would use the WEBSERVICE function with FILTERXML.

This will return the current value for AAPL.

=FILTERXML(WEBSERVICE("http://dev.markitondemand.com/MODApis/Api/v2/Quote/xml?symbol=AAPL"),"StockQuote/LastPrice")

You could replace AAPL with a cell reference containing a given symbol.
Any idea how to do this in Google Sheets?  Would be even cooler if you could benchmark percent up/down from time added, time bought, etc

Is there a Google sheets sub as well? Curious

I would imagine at least the standard 15 minutes but I don't know for sure.

Great thanks!
I tried this solution, to be honest, it is very elegant and I wish Microsoft had a similar feature

That feel
