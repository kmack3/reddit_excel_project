How would I find out the average buying price when I will be having 300,000 units to factor in?
Everyone else already gave you the answer, but the concept you're looking for is called Weighed Average
The way that makes it easiest to see whats happening is to have a new column with quantity X buying price, then sum up this column and divide by the total number of units 
    =SUMPRODUCT(A1:A10,B1:B10/SUM(A1:A10))
Assuming your Units are in column A and your Price is in column B. You might have to remove the x from your units though.

This is a classic power pivot problem. Throw it into a power pivot data model and then you can do much more with your data.
thanks for the reply, I tried doing what you said and got this

Yep, the x was giving me a null each time I tried to use a function 
Couldn't that be entered as a regular formula? And also isnt it basically the same as sumproduct?
Turns out the x prefix value was messing me up so I got rid of it. posted in the pic in comments. Thank you for your help, also. 
Power Pivot is totally unnecessary for this and is probably not a great choice for a user who seems like a novice.

For future knowledge, you could've used "text to columns" to separate them out.
