Excel 2016 files will open as "Read Only" when opened from a SharePoint library. This is a "new feature" and there's no way to change it.
I'm going to assume that you're not in favour of this change? 

To me it sounds like a good move. Also isn't this true now? In order to edit files in a share point library you have to 'check out' the file? 

The part that makes no sense is that there's *no way to turn the feature off* - not in Excel and not in the SharePoint library. 

I hesitate to make this discussion about SharePoint (in an Excel subreddit), but many people are using SharePoint as a file server and oftentimes such protection is not necessary.
This.  This change SUCKS.  I NEVER edit Excel files with someone else as it makes no sense in the work flow I have, but we do store files Excel files on SP.  This wouldn't be a big deal except multiple times now I get an error message saying 'cannot connect to sever' which means I CAN'T EDIT THE FILE.

Seriously, no way to turn something like this off is just bullshit.
