Filter with right click!
If you are working on a full keyboard, you may have a [Context Menu key](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sgzBP.jpg), i.e., right click. You don't need the mouse to use this shortcut. 

If you don't have a context menu key, Shift+F10 also brings up the right click menu. 
Dude, haven't been on in a while, first post I saw. Huge tip, thank you for sharing.
Does anyone remember there used to be a "filter excluding selected cell value" in the context menu? I'm sure it was there in an earlier version of excel, and I miss it. 
.... Excel still blows my mind. 3 years of using Excel and I thought I discovered everything I needed
Added keyboard shortcuts to filter directly =D

A true genius knows that you never truly know everything.
Wise words. Going to print this onto a plaque and display on my desk.
