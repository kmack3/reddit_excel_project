I'm an amateur in a professional world. How can I apply conditional formatting to attain my desired result?

This is just an example and the actual spreadsheet is much larger than this.
Are you working with whole months or number of days?

For instance, this formula would return the number of whole months from the date in A1 to today, rounded down to the nearest whole month.

    =IF(DAY(NOW())>=DAY(A1),0,-1)+(YEAR(NOW())-YEAR(A1)) *12+MONTH(NOW())-MONTH(A1)

If you were to add a >18 to the end of it, it becomes boolean, which should satisfy your 1st conditional. You can modify the formula to fit the range using AND.

Let me know if this is on the right path.
Cheers.
rule for red in C1: =(TODAY()-A1)/30.417>18

rule for yellow in C1: =AND((TODAY()-A1)/30.417>14,(TODAY()-A1)/30.417<18)

30.417 is the average days in each month of the year. 


based on this you should figure out the rest...I'm off to bed
Quick question, is this how you want the formatting? 

* Under 14 months: No format (white)
* 14-18 months and IC: Yellow
* Over 18 months and IC: Red
* 14-18 months and Complete: Green
* Over 18 months and Complete: Orange
Use Conditional Formatting for Column B and C.

Click on Column B > Conditional Formatting > New, then use [this formula.](http://i.imgur.com/PYApqpK.png)

Click on Column C > Conditional Formatting > New, then use [this formula.](http://i.imgur.com/VXCSXfT.png)

=C1>A1+180

and

=C1>A1+14*30
Months would be fine. I am honestly brand new to excel and don't comprehend the process of changing around a formula to fit my needs. I'm going to try your formula and see if that works though. 
I tried both of these formulas and played around with the date to check and I didn't get any results. 
That is all correct except if it is complete it will be green regardless 
I actually need the color of C to reference between A and today's date, not the date in C
you did put these rules under conditional formating right?
So who gets orange?
Yeah, that's why you should put the formula that I showed [under the column called "Rule":](http://i.imgur.com/VXCSXfT.png)

=C1>A1+14*30

and 

=C1>A1+180

Only the incomplete cell in column B will be orange
OK, I think /u/speqter's solution gets you there.  Have you tried it?
