What are YOU using Excel for?
Ever wanted a file that comes down to your inbox to be automatically saved down, processed, replicated, PDFed, a back up created, emailed out to 10 people, and then archived for future purposes, and a confirmation email that's all been done sent to boot - all done at 3AM!?!!?

That's what macros can do for you. Without you even needing to be in the office.

Excel is the tool that allows macros to do that for you.

P.S. Flair changed to discussion. Please keep the sub tidy.

2) To win my fantasy baseball league
Well, among other things I leave complicated excel sheets up on the desktop of my 2nd monitor to look like I'm doing something other than posting on Reddit.  (kidding.  Most of the time.)
Inventory analyst. I use Excel in conjunction with SQL generated reports to measure inventory health in a distribution environment. I use the metrics generated to provide feedback to operational teams and drive accuracy in their procedures. I also build templates to help operations track production on a more granular levels. 
I'm a Medical NCO in the Army. I use excel to create calendars for my soldiers to know when they are seeing patients. I use it for creating patient trackers to spot trends in illness/injury across our battalion. I use it to track inventory of medical supplies and equipment and let me know when services are due or meds are going to expire. I use it to track who has completed mandatory training. I use it to calculate PT scores/weapons qualification and tell me when someone needs to take their next test or go back to the range.

I love excel, and I use it almost constantly. 
I keep a master inventory of all my belongings. Video games, instruments, movies ect. I have separate tabs for each "category" and I include the following for each item:

Qty, Serial Number (if available), Box/Manual, Cost and Value. The totals are added up at the bottom of each tab.

It was a daunting task at first but now just adding one here and there is fine. I use this to see where all my money goes and so I know EXACTLY what insurance premiums to buy so everything is replaceable. 

I also keep this in my Google Drive so if something gets stolen, I can access it from anywhere and tell the police the S/N and such.
I'm a project manager in a large investment bank. I analyse screeds of transactional data, attach it to reference data and calculate risk profiles... I then compare this to system outputs and present options and scenarios to management. VLOOKUP, pivot tables and VBA are my stock in trade (no pun intended!). Also, automating the shit out the above. Because fundamentally I'm lazy!
I'm working for one of the biggest forwarding companies in Europe.

So we are getting hundreds of very big rate requests by large companies (you would know very many of them) all in excel format, but all of them in different styles, sizes and quality of data.

We have an offering system which requires a specified excel design to import the data. 

I'm the magician who does it in about 5 to 30 minutes with my own tool. 

Before this department was installed, 20 assistants have done this decentral and have suffered doing this in a certain quality and time.

Since then, I also have made a few other excel files with macros that are used in the whole company and helped increasing the productivity of some employees.
Accounting/financial analyst here. I use it to analyze the shit out of millions and millions of dollars.
I'm an analyst. I analyze data related to grant funded projects and create evaluative reports based on my analyses. 

I use excel to make charts and tables and I use it to run statistics for quantitative data.  I use it sometimes simply to count with large sets of data as well.

Oh!  And at home, I use excel to create monthly spending/budget sheets to track my own financial situation.
Everything.  Yes, I use it for work, but I also use it for everything else.  Friend's wedding budget, excel laid out on a table with pictures, with a weighted rank based on a 1-10 desire rating on multiple categories for the bride and groom.

Guest list? All the names listed below, with categories for which promoter brought them, estimated amount they will spend based on the average amount spent on guests from that promoter, and estimated revenue for the night.

Bachelor Party?  Google docs excel sent to all the recipients, letting them choose which venues they want to go to, what events are most important to them, updated contact lists, and how much they will ultimately need to bring.

And anything else that requires me to keep track of anything.  I even use excel when I have to write certain documents.  It's not always the easiest way, and yes, you could write a macro that can transfer the data to word, but I find excel just so much easier, and the ad hoc abilities are limitless.

There was an Ask Reddit thread that asked "If your life was a game, what would it be called?"  I answered "Microsoft Excel."  
I made a custom quoting template that I've picked away at for the last 10 years related to my job in sales.  Right now it sometimes feels like a program, but it's just a functionally designed template that hides and reveals ranges of rows and columns as need be.  It's very organized and suitably presentable.  I sometimes step back and realize how cool it is, but it's something I can never sell or even share with my co-workers.  The amount of detail and flexibility it allows me probably costs me about 1/10th the amount of time my colleagues take to do the same things, and I'll have way more detail, information and much easier time making adjustments.  It takes a little bit of management updating price tables and many lists we don't get in digital form so I have to manually enter things when we get an update or new products, but other than that, it's made my job extremely more efficient.
I use Excel and VBA to process data at a law firm. I got bored last Friday and made a Minesweeper clone that you play on a spreadsheet.
What cards am I missing in my baseball card collection? Well, pivot table, and done. This is how I started with spreadsheets as a kid, without the pivot table though.

Want to add two numbers? Well, I dont keep a calculator at my desk, and my phone is too far away in my pants pocket. Excel to save the day.

Ever run reports based on Access\Excel every few hours based on input from databases, and other **Excel\Access** files containing user inputs? Timed macros, or windows task scheduler with vbscripts. Pop them on a dedicated machine, never have to touch them again. Reports for big morning meetings starting at 8 AM? They can be scheduled too. Pop in code for outlook emails, and send those off to people.

Managing hundreds of Excel files in multiple folders? Well, build a dashboard, add some custom functions, and you can manage them too. Can tell you if the file(s) were deleted, renamed, etc. You can even add a hyperlink to the folder\file path.
Tracking the expense and full year projections of a $200M department.
I was an engineering intern, i used it to automate the mindless tasks they give interns such as filling out 150 forms with specific lists of data and signatures, spent a week developing it so I could run it in 2 minutes and be done with all my work 
I use it to find engine torque, wheel speed, and tractive force at every point through an engines torque curve thus giving me force data for other parts of the vehicle at different speeds and accelerations so that I can run Finite Element Analysis on those parts. This let me design parts to be extremely light and still durable! 
Fluid mechanics
I work in the solar industry and started off analyzing bills. Then created new and better ways to run different rate schedules and finance options. I also design and engineer the systems. Wire size calcs, voltage drop, and temp corrections all dropped into a beautiful chart ready to be put in a plan set. Job costing and analyzing historical costs as they apply to different jobs. Solar power output and savings. Shade calculator to determine length of shadows at specific latitudes. Pulling down info and addresses from different websites for marketing and territory planning. 

I'm a little bit of an excel addict, so this comes home with me, and I use it to figure out personal loan strategies, investments, and budgeting. I also come up with thought problems just as an excuse to use excel to calculate random things for practice :)
I made a time card program for my boss at work that she really likes. It's a little hacked together since it was an early project, but the coding is still sound. 

I also made a big log of closed files I scanned in, as that is my main job.  

I also made a fancy program in excel that I scan in an interrogatory as text and convert it into our response and plug in some basic automatic responses, before transferring that to an actual attorney to fill out. Turns something that used to take me 2 days to do into something I do within 20 minutes. 

In my personal life, I've created a giant 'Fact of the Day' database. Originally it was for when I was bartending, to have a little gimmick each day. But I use it for other stuff now. My webcomic, or just annoying friends with new information.  

I also do a lot of stuff with Google Spreadsheets in /r/HarryPotter for fun things. I developed score sheets for trivia games, lesson plan templates for classes, and even a fun battleship/minesweeper mashup thing for a quidditch game! 

Renewable energy analyst. Whole company uses it for simple data prep for graphs etc and number crunching. But I use it for pretty complex data modelling, lots of VBA and power pivot (mostly power pivot these days thankfully)
Wow. Any chance you could share this macro with scrubbed e-mail addresses?
How long did it take you to get you to where you are now? In terms of skills in Excel/macros 
> To those who use Bloomberg, ever wanted to take data from Bloomberg without having to use the data license or the API? Excel can do that too...

You're fucking with me. HOW?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!
Ok, so I'm going to get hung up on this part.

> all done at 3AM!?!!?

I'm going to make a reasonable assumption that normally you would prefer to be sleeping at 3am, thus infer you've got some form of active monitoring baked into this macro of yours and it triggers off some keyword criteria. 

What is this magic you've put into place? 

Any chance you could elaborate a bit and point in the right direction on constructing macros like this?

Given that you've got this thing set up to automatically send email out to other individuals, I'd imagine the error handling baked in would be worth further discussion as well. 
September always means creating another big fantasy NFL draft sheet.

I usually start of with a preliminary analysis (positional price/rank distributions etc), then put in some recommendations (draft and avoid) from analysts, also an interface that I update so i can determine who's the best player still on the board combined with mock draft stats to determine if a player will be available next round and budgeting so I don't go overboard in auction draft.

Post draft stuff involves seeing costs/rounds where players drafted their positions to determine best trade opportunities.
They are as important as each other
Have you looked into using inventory management systems outside of excel?
|NCO... mandatory training.


Story checks out.  ATMS/DTMS is terrible at tracking mandatory training.  I created a very basic table that tracks how many days remaining for each "training" the Soldier needs.  So, when BN needs that "STATS ASAP!" before the weekend, it is as easy as opening the damned document.


Seeing these guys posts about macros makes me feel like an ant among gods, though.
Besides, you are also prepared for a pre-nup
Getting those SNs would have helped when I had some stuff stolen recently. The police asked if I happened to have them. I was confused and thought to myself "why would anyone record that". Well now I know! I did get the insurance part right though, so I got it covered less the deductible.
what do you mean by value? and if you mean current reselling price of "old inventory", how do you set it?
That's what I love about excel, I once spent an entire day writing code that reduces the time a process takes by 5 minutes. Granted, it saves 5 minutes for a lot of people, but my motivation was laziness 
So did you replace the 20 assistants? What happened to them? Hahaha
I've been working on my own recently.
Any chance you'd be kind enough to upload an empty template of your beautiful creation?  Or maybe throw some fake numbers in so I can see how it works?  
Sorry if I'm asking for too much.
Afraid not, corporate property and all that. Last thing I'd want is someone to recognise the macro I wrote, report me to UDA and I get done for selling trade secrets or something like that (which I wrote from scratch).
It took me 4 months to go from 0 to employable based on Macro skills alone, and then another 8 months to where I am now.

To  be honest, it's an unrealistic timeline, people take YEARS to get to where I am now.
Haha I probably shouldn't say. It's actually quite inefficient, but not impossible. And things do go wrong on occasion so it's not fool proof either. 
I have my work PC turned on overnight.

When an email comes in, a rule fires off.    
This rules runs the a macro which saves down the attachment.   
It then loads an Excel file.   
The Excel file fires off a bunch more macros which find the attachment that was just saved down and go crazy doing their thing.   
When it's all done (as above) it saves and closes down, and sends me a confirmation email that it was all done.

It's actually not that hard to program to be fair...
I would assume he's using Windows Task Scheduler to run his excel file+macro at 3am daily.
We use a Manhattan solution for building inventory. I'm basically the translator with Excel for the operations managers and directors. 
Haha true!
Man that is sad to hear. I used to work in a music shop and people would call in and report stolen instruments. The serial numbers being in the system helped us once or twice.
Value is based on a rough current market value. I only use this for music gear, weapons and video games mostly. Anything with resell value. I base it off an average of **sold** Ebay listings.

I also add a cell that subtracts the value from the cost. This shows me how much I would lose/gain from selling the one item, or everything in the selected tab.
No, but a large part of their work is now in my hands, so the company could overthrow plans to increase personnel.

And they got other responsibilities.
Hey!  No, you're not asking too much.  :)

Mine's nothing special.  I just have total money coming in each month and then subtract all of my expenses from that to tell me how much I have left over to spend each month.

Then I have another sheet that uses that left over to spend number and I just put my purchases in a column on that sheet.  The purchases subtract from how much I have to spend each month.  So when I look at it I can see how much I've spent and how much I have left to spend.

I have Google Drive on my phone so it's easy enough to access the sheets on the go.

I reset it at the start of each new month by just clearing out all of the purchases for the previous month.
That is awesome and beyond what I use excel for, but I also feel that that's not necessarily an excel specific task.  Mircrosoft Word for example, has Macros as well, and I would guess that it can do that to. 

Not diminishing your excel abilities in any way, which are beyond mine, just saying that that particular requirement would go beyond excel alone, and be more of a "What do you use macros for" type thing.

But fricken awesome that you use the macros in excel to do that.  
Worth a shot. I might be interested in replicating just to improve my VBA skills. 
Excuse the ignorance; but if you wrote it, why is it corporate property? Why can you not replicate the macro to distribute?
What study/learning methods have you used? I have barely used my first macro at work and took a 2 hour task into 15 minutes, but I could shrink it down with a loop I haven't figured out yet... Took me about 6 hours to write the code which is pretty basic. Hah!
OK, *fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiine*. 

I got access to Factset on my laptop through the academic account so I can get most of the info on the fly so it's not so bad. The platform is pretty clunky though. 
I haven't been leveraging cross-program functionality as I should. Light-bulb that probably should have gone off some time ago finally lit up. 

I've got a few processes to automate. Thanks!
As an ops/Sys admin, this really gets to me. Something as important as this is hinging on one computer at one desk being turned on. I literally shuddered when I read that. Also, simply being dependent on an email coming in has always been rather inefficient.

But if you need to accomplish this with excel, fine, but put excel on a VM on a server in a Datacenter somewhere. Please. 
"When an email comes in, a rule fires off.    
This rules runs the a macro which saves down the attachment.   
It then loads an Excel file.   "

That's some clever shit right there. 
Ok. And how often do you update the values? And are you using a Makro?
Actually, did you know you can use Excel to interact directly with Window's interface using the API? I can even make the mouse and keyboard do what I want.

Have you seen what this guy did?

https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2jtd2f/worked_on_a_completely_locked_down_machine_time/

He doesn't know VBA - but he knows Windows API commans which Excel can work with, and he managed to pull that off. Smart guy.

Google is your friend. Say no more xD
Because I wrote it in company hours for company use so it's company property. You'll find that little stickler in lots of contracts, I found it in mine too. 

Plus, it went through an entire approval process and a committee.
See the thread stickied on the front page? I contributed to it xD
I'd shy away from macros if at all possible though. I love macros as much as the next guy and I've made some fancy ones, but they're very inflexible and inelegant. And slow, depending on what you need it to do. And Excel has a lot of limitations.

I'd write a macro for either something super simple that takes up a lot of time, like data cleaning or entry, or for something *very* indoctrinated that will not change for like the next year or so. That's my 2 cents anyways.
I'm onboard with this conceptually, but the process of selling this kind of stuff to IT in some companies can be weeks, if not months, of work, then some waiting and a little bit of waiting more. 

At a point in the waiting, some people find their own solutions because it's no fun to bash against a brick wall and leadership tires of the 'Blame IT' game. 
This is just a little something for me, it's nothing mission critical. We have an entire development team working on the more important stuff, all properly controlled at the back end, set up with controls and automatons not using VBA =) 
Since I have to do it manually I only do it once a year. It's not a business so there is no need to stay on top of it and keep it current all the time. I use [Video Game Price Charting](http://videogames.pricecharting.com/) for my video games. That is the most daunting task. Fortunately this site is laid out very well and makes it easy.
What I love about excel, is that despite using it almost every day, and being the one in every place I work that people go to for excel questions, I always learn that there's so much more to excel, and people doing things I never even thought of.  

It's really cool, and just tip my hat to the guys who are actually updating excel every iteration.  That said, I hated the ribbon when it came out, but now I'm used to it.  
I haven't looked in this much. Thanks for pointing it out..hmmmm!
Wow. That's unfortunate. It is exactly opposite in my case. When a resource is discovered and there isn't enough knowledge share, security, or redundancy, we wait for the customer or end user to cooperate with us. 
Oh gotcha, well ok then :)

A lot of times those little things that our analysts do turn out to be more important than they think. And then when they leave the company their manager is sitting with their face in their hands not sure how to meet some requirement.
It's probably sufficient enough, and in case you need to sell you can always check the specific item. I found the Video Game Price Charting really interesting since I also have a little collection of games, although my situation is different since I am in Europe which is a smaller market.
I was the same with the ribbon - but now I've filled up an entire tab with a bunch of my own custom macros, its so damned useful!!

I even made my own menu bar with drops downs and everything.
> sitting with their face in their hands not sure how to meet some requirement.

Story of my life bro...
Yea that would mean you require the PAL versions right? I like the site because it has more options when you click the actual game. it is reliable 9/10. Every now and then I have to do further research because the "CIB" option is a little iffy. 
Exactly.
