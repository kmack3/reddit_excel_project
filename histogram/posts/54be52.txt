I made a Tetris game in Excel
Cool, thanks for sharing! would you mind if I added the link (and maybe the "Snake" link from a year ago as well) to the games section of the wiki?

Good for you. You join Snakes and several board games (Mastermind, Yahtzee, Lines/5-in-a-row to name just a few).
I didn't even know this was possible. Thanks for sharing. I didn't see this in the sidebar. I always use an app on my phone and don't see the side bar stuff. 
THis is awesome! how'd you learn to code like this?
I don't mind. Thanks!
Thanks! I've been a Excel developer for many years. Besides that, I like studying computer programming in general.
