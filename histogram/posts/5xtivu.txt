[Video] Combining worksheets from all workbooks in a folder into a single workbook
Nice Video! I haven't used dir before but it looks a lot simpler and cleaner than the fso-stuff I usually end up doing (like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5x9z6i/im_looking_to_merge_data_from_multiple_files_with/)). I'll give it a go next time I do something like this.




I pronounce "Dir" as "Dire" because it is short for "Directory".

Great, this is just what I've been looking for. I know nothing about VBA though. What is the best way to start learning?
Where's the code?
I pronounce it "durectory"
