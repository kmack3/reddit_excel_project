How do I make excel count the number of cells that contain something in a column?
Try using COUNTA. 

=COUNTA(A1:A10) 
You could also do 

    COUNTIF (A1:A10,<>"")
If you just need to take a quick peek, you can highlight the entire column or subrange you are interested in.  There is a status bar at the bottom right of Excel that shows basic formula results for the selected cells.  I forget if Count is visible by default, but [the right click menu](http://www.excel-easy.com/ogi/examples/status-bar.png) lets you customize what shows up.

Just be sure to subtract your header rows from the count when selecting the entire column or row.
