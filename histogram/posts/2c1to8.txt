Two huge headaches that I found answers to today
Haven't converted excel to PDF in a while but this is good to know, thanks. 
Many thanks and an upvote.

I had a similar issue, when saving Powerpoint 2013 Files as PDF. The inbuilt save feature inflates the sizes and even after much tweaking I could not get the final size to reduce. Most of the times the PDF size would be more than the powerpoint.

Sites like http://smallpdf.com/compress-pdf does an excellent job at reducing pdf file size, but I cannot expose the information on the Internet.

I am still looking for a way around,and looking at your code, I have hope I might soon get a solution. I don't have any coding experience. Can you guide me to any source?

Edit: Powerpoint Version
Thanks for posting, that was really helpful!
I'm not familiar with using code for Powerpoint...I think VBA is relatively standard for all of microsoft office products but I'm not familiar at all with Powerpoint.  Also I don't think VBA would even be a way to fix this...try posting in the r/microsoft or r/software subreddit maybe?
Sometimes the problem can be that you are keeping images in your PowerPoint at a needlessly high resolution, or if you have cropped the image you can still have the deleted parts of the image in the file. Have you tried compressing the images? 

To do this save a copy of your PowerPoint, double click on any image, and select "compress pictures"  click "option" to keep your resolution at 220 ppi. It should ask you to compress all of the images in your PowerPoint at once.
I think they removed VBA from PowerPoint a couple of versions ago. Because Microsoft.
