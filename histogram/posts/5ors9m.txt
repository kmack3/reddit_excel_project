I spent quite a bit of time preparing a dummy sheet and writing out a full post and in so I found a simple solution to my issue.

I feel like I'm border line stalking you at this point. But you sharing my site has certainly made my day. Appreciate it once again. (also I randomly dropped in this discussion!! I SWEAR!)
This post was reported for being spam, which, honestly it is. While we always appreciate people sharing great ressources, the link is out of context and there is no text indicating why you think it belongs in this discussion post. So I'm going to agree with the reporter. 

If you do find occasion to share some of the resources /u/itsnotaboutthecell provides on his site, or if someone asks for links to kickass sites, you can link it then, and please do so with some content other than just a link. 

I had never heard of that site before, and I just spent the last half hour absorbing all I could. Keep up the good work! 
Understood - wish I would have screen capped it. Felt like a very bold statement with just leaving a website url - similar to leaving a business card with only a phone number. Curiosity of who or what lies on the other line. Either way thanks for keeping the site tidy.
Thank you! I greatly appreciate you swinging by - I'm terrible at being a content machine but I've been working on doing live casts over on Facebook during the in betweens. http://www.facebook.com/itsnotaboutthecell
