Loan amortization table
Your formula in G11 is incorrect - the values in that column represent the remaining principal of the loan and therefore should only be reducing by the amount of the principal payment calculated in column F. 
Thank you. Does that mean by value in d12,d13,d14,etc are also incorrect? I am assuming that cell g11=d12, g12=d13, g13=d14, etc

Yep - you got it! Opening balance in column D should reference the prior period closing.
