This YouTube channel has been supremely helpful
I agree, it's a fantastic channel with great topics. Love the way he teaches/reminds you about shortcuts all the way through the videos as well. 
I get a real kick from the way he is so *excited* to teach you something!


New to this sub, thank you very much for the resource! 
Agreed. I manage a group of accountants. Whenever someone new comes along I always have them watch a few videos from this guy to make sure they're up to par with what we do. I love how he always emphasis the keyboard shortcuts too. Great channel from a guy who really loves what he does. 
Thanks for this !
Thank you i have been looking for a proper Youtube channel to teach me more about Excel and  this looks like just the thing i was looking for.
Came here to say this. Mike sounds enthusiastic, every single video!
