The FRED Add-In for Excel is awesome. Is there anyway I could build a similar tool for my company's databases?

Having said that - VBA passwords are often very hackable

Ha!  I just came back to this page right after hacking the password.  Your comment is too funny.

It's not really an add-in that I would personally use, but maybe the code can teach me a trick or two about importing data.
don't tempt me then not post the password...
Oh, sorry.  I don't have a clue what the password is.  I just broke the password it was storing and when you reopen the add-in it fixes the file.

1.  Change extension from .xlam to .zip
2.  Open zip file
3.  Open the "xl" folder, find vbaProject.bin, and extract it out of the archive for editing
4.  Open with a hex editor
5.  Search for "DPB=" and change it to "DPx="
6.  Save and close .bin file
7.  Copy .bin back into zip file and overwrite the old one
8.  Change extension back to .xlam
9.  Open file, hit Yes and OK until the popups about errors stop
10.  Hit Save in the Visual Basic Editor to save the fixed version

I am digging their use of MultiPage.  I hadn't known about that option for user forms.  That one could come in really handy for me to combine several of my macro front ends into one interface.

Edit:  typos
Yea left us hanging...
It's much easier to use a hex editor to replace the current password string with a password sting of a known value than to figure out what the actual password is.
