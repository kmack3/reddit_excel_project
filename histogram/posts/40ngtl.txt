What percentage of your workday is spent in Excel and what do you do?
Corporate accountant, it's open about 95% of the time. Though if I'm honest I only "work" in it about 30% of the day. Reddit eats up the other 70%.
analysis 75% - 90%
Analytics / BI.

~40% Excel, ~40% SQL/BI, ~20% Coffee

(change this post flair to discussion, please!)
Not-For-Profit company Accountant - 70%

Former Auditor - 85%  (with the other 15% being rage and defeat)
Management Consulting:

70% - Excel

25% Word or Power Point

5% Email and Pulling Data
Finance, probably 90% but I am no where near as good as you guys. I just recently learned VLookups. 
Cost Estimation
90% Excel
10% Reddit
Military HR... 50/50 between excel and Milpds
30 to 60% of my day. Data Analysis. 
Used to be all day. With the addition of Tableau and Alteryx in the past couple years, I do little to no work in Excel anymore .VBA has been replaced by Alteryx, which is much quicker to understand with a lot less syntax issues, and visualization making has been taken over by Tableau. Only real reason I'm using Excel at all anymore is because I haven't been able to tap into all of the tables I need, so I'm relying on other people's Excel outputs. 

I work in BI. 
Sales Operations:

70% Excel

20% Proprietary system

10% Everything else

Our entire commissions/incentive program from ~700 sales reps is down out of excel with a ton of updating daily due to turnover. It's atrocious. I'm not an excel wizard by any means. Wish someone would show me how to do it better!

edit - formatting
Private and public auditor: 73%. 
Process engineering. I do a lot of reports in excel, as well as just manipulating a data table for quick analysis or before moving it to another analysis program.
75% - administration assistant.
Data analyst. Used to be around 60% of the time. I switched now to R and Powerbi, and now between R and PBI I spend around 75% of the day.
Analysis - 95%

I turn everything into a macro.  Currently use excel to automate a weekly PowerPoint slide presentation of resource utilization metrics to all global departments.   7 presentations, 60 to 100 slides per presentation.

Can't wait for us to get a real ERP system.
Open 100% of the time. Used probably 30% of the time, Python 20%, SQL 30% and the balance in Spotfire/Powerpoint/surfing the web.

Quant - finance.

Sometimes seems like 200% - run macro, crash, debug, crash, debug, crash, lightbulb moment, crash with different problem, debug, crash, debug, crash, debug, finally get it to work with some obscure thing. Open different sheet, and wonder why it runs a lot slower on Office 365 Excel using a 12-core all-PCIe-storage workstation as opposed to how I remember it running in 2003 on a clapped-out quad-core that we retired.  Dream wistfully about abacuses. 

I move family money around. 

30 %

I use it as a calculator since I lost mine and afraid to ask for a new one.
Maintenance and other office paper work stuff 10%
It'd be nice to be in a job that made more use of this, but oh well.

It's rare I don't have at least 1 excel file open at work. I'm a process engineer so it's mainly using Aspen IP21 to import data and analyze it or monitor, but I also develop tools and automated reports to make my life, and my coworkers lives, easier. 



I would say actual time spent in excel is anywhere from 50%-100% on any given day. My excel completely crashed and was unopenable last week,  and I felt like a lost puppy. I couldn't do anything haha...

All day Err day
For me too. If I have Excel open everyone assumes I'm working on something. 
For me as well but a lot of it is running reports that open in excel.
Are we coworkers? Same here. 
Also analysis, and its pretty much exactly the same. I use SQL for the rest and access for a couple small reports.
nice!
so jealous! 

how'd you get into that line?
Same here but replace coffee with fixing people's computer problems since the company that just bought us out has a worthless IT team.
lol rage and defeat is so fitting. or 15% documenting away exceptions
Only 15%?  Must have been a Godlike auditor.
How did you get into the field? 
What do you do
[deleted]
nice!
Same and same.
sounds fun, i want in. 
I gave Tableau a shot the other day.  I couldn't seem to make nearly as well of a dashboard with it.  That isn't to say it couldn't be done, but poking and prodding it like you can Excels tables and charts didn't seem to come as easy to me.
Do you mind if I ask how much someone in your position usually get paid? I'm a VBA/Tableau person too and have always wondered if I should tap into BI.
I'm in Sales Incentives as an Analyst and usually work very closely with Sales Ops. Our incentive program for about 650 reps is also done using excel. Glad someone feels the pain of maintaining hundreds of reports using excel.
i like your precision
How did you get approval to make the switch?
This sounds kind of interesting. Can you TR:DR version the basics?
Fire
Hi, what is your age?
financial?
[deleted]
underwriting?
What's the rest?
Securitization or covereds?
Is that different from sales support?
was considering real estate finance as a career path. do you enjoy?
damn, really?
what do you do
sounds awesome. enjoy it? 
I decided to just make a web browser in Excel, this way I can browse reddit and my IE is never opened.
yeah i need to practice with SQL more, some things just aren't practical to do in Excel
Quite a non-traditional career path. I worked retail loss-prevention and applied for an opportunity at corporate in a loss-prevention operations manager position. Basically the role of the job was to perform analysis of unknown losses and find the source.

I took this role and succeeded, teaching myself SQL along the way as I grew impatient having to rely upon others to fetch data.

A while later, I convinced my director that if I was able to move a lot of the things I was doing into a BI platform (MicroStrategy in this case), we could help our store folks in performing this research themselves rather than having my team do everything.
Same - Im the BI/analyst guy on a finance team, and have become the de facto IT guy. 
Alumni network, the firm was recruiting from my school. 
I work for a Japanese automotive supplier. It's a pretty fun field but mind numbing at times.

What do you do for your job? I compare component and process costs for each design level of the product.
We really are trying to hire someone currently, but we are in sore need of someone who already has a strong foot-hold in Tableau or other similar tools. 

They both are really cool tools that aren't *too* terribly hard to learn, but a good base in Excel helps a ton. 

If you are into manipulating data the like I would check out the free trials of both. They are super interesting tools. Also, for a cool 5k you can get Alteryx scheduler, which you can schedule on a desktop to run reports for you over-night. Already saving us tons of time, but we've only had it for a couple months now, so I'm sure we aren't using it to it's full capacity.
The charts and graphs themselves are only slightly better than Excel, IMO, outside of the maps. The real benefit comes in the form of being able to direct connect and put your SQL directly into Tableau, which can handle way more data than Excel, much more quickly. Also, Table calculations and level of detail calculations are quite useful. Parameters are super cool. It has it's limitations and it definitely takes some time to learn how to work around those limitations. I would recommend doing a low level intro class if your company is willing to pay for it. 

Here is a link to my Tab Public profile. I was doing some FF dashboards for a while, but I stopped updating after Thanksgiving because no one was really using it anymore. It's a pretty good example of the power of Tableau, though. 

https://public.tableau.com/profile/shane3650#!/

Currently, we have reporting that runs SQL into Alteryx starting at 12:01 AM, Alteryx then performs the data manipulation, and Publishes a .tde(Tableau Data Extract) file directly to the Tableau server, which has a live connection to our daily performance dashboards. This means by 12:15 AM everyday, this dashboard is completely updated and I've had to touch absolutely nothing. You can also send out notification emails through Tableau and Alteryx, but we're still working out getting through our firewall with those, so that is the only manual work we are doing for that report now. 
Next beer or beverage of your choice will be in your honor. 
Actually my boss asked me to do the switch.
Pull time data from existing system via SQL

Compile/compute weekly and by resource utilization and billable % metric tables

Throw pivots on everything and then pivot charts

Loop through each region, set pivots, updating graphs

Create PowerPoint object, populate slides with graphs

Save presentations

Mathcad is awesome! I use it for things that have a very specific process and where seeing the formulas can be beneficial. 
Appraisals and commercial investment planning.
Research, presentations. 
Raising bonds.
I would say yes. I work in an engineering group for a third party logistics provider. It's an industrial engineering role (designing networks, facilities, and processes) for new business opportunities that we are pursuing. Approximately a third of my job is sales pursuit, design, and modeling , another third is implementation of business that was won, and the other third is continuous improvement, split between internal tools and processes, and improvements to business we already manage and run. 
I enjoy it a lot. Right now just working mostly with cost estimates and simple cash flows, but it can get so much more complicated with waterfalls, land residuals, and genetic algorithms.
Yea. We use Salesforce for our CRM, but that's  just 1 tool. I use excel to:

Keep track of clients (contact info, last contacted, close %, notes)  [this is for personal tracking, this information. Is also relayed to salesforce]

Create Insertion orders (contracts for executing campaigns. There's a whole lot of numbers involved)

Analytics 

Inventory checks

And that's pretty much how I spend my day. 


Started in investment banking right out of college, then went into commercial real estate. I've worked at a few real estate private equity firms and REITs, and now I'm now a real estate developer.  I source, structure and close deals now, so I tell the analysts what to do, and only get behind the computer screen when I feel like it.

I love excel, and I'm fairly good at it.  Not a master by any means, but good enough that I've always been the excel guru wherever I've worked.  

The 15% is mostly because I still like to run my own analyses sometimes, and I have a certain way I like my presentation deliverables to look, but it could be as little as 1% if I wanted it to.
Excel gets annoying sometimes. Not always the most capable program to use but for the most part yeah. 
Why have I not tried this?! 
I've come across this a lot at my job. I really need more training in SQL though and getting that at work is like pulling teeth.
Did that actually work out for your team? I was asked to teach our folks some excel, so they could do more on their own. The problem is, they haven't learned much because they weren't interested in learning it at all and now that they know my excel skills, whenever they are beeing asked to do sth. a bit more complicated, they come to me, so my workload actually increased.
>  if I was able to move a lot of the things I was doing into a BI platform (MicroStrategy in this case), we could help our store folks in performing this research themselves

So now you're in application support rather than analysis. ;)
[deleted]
For a cool 0k I use task scheduler to run several reports in excel for my company :D
Yeah I have some class material and videos available through Lynda.com from my school and plan to watch them when I'm done with the SQL class I'm in.  I have to get through my actual class before I can piss away time learning something that isn't required.  One of the Crime Analysts that left my city recently to be a Data Analyst for a private company said they have a setup similar to yours.  I do want to learn it as I'm sure there's potential there that just needs the know-how to unlock it.
God Bless you
So after your macro all of this is a turnkey/pushbutton export from an excel macro into a executive level formatted powerpoint? If so, cool! I'll have to step up my automation game!
Indeed, like when presenting calculation reports.
mathcad is the bane of my life, it should have been thrown out years ago. - we use smath when we have to now as the export to word (via odt) is much better and its free. But tbh it all needs to go and just use latex markup when you want to write something and excel/ coding when you need to calculate something. 
how'd you get into that?
very cool. you in the NYC area by any chance? been looking to do similar but i don't think i have a shot. 
Two parts - my team at corporate is an analytics team, so they're used to dealing with excel and they help me build models and distribute the load on some of the issues we face.

My "customer", the store people, were already analytically-minded people, they just didn't have access to any of the correct data. We for a long time shoved a ridiculous amount of data down their throats without really giving them any context. What I did was take all of the data we were sending down and removed it where it didn't make sense, and brought it in to our BI platform in a format that actually made sense when it *was* relevant.

So in summary, yes, it worked... but it seems like it's a much different situation than you were involved in.

edit: grammar.
Nope! That's actually one of the nice things about my company - there is a separate "Systems" support team within our team that supports the applications once I make them!

At least for simple things - if there are issues with the data or something more complex, it's generally something I would want to know about anyway, and that gets funneled back to me.
Small boutique firm, only about 20 consultants and a few partners. I went to a top 100 school. Our B-school was top 50. Grades were meh, but I skidded into the econ honor society. Needed to cut my teeth in industry for a year before  getting a good enough rep to land in MC. My other prior work experience was congressional intern and a summer marketing job at a startup. 
I like that. I actually tried that coupled with Autoit on a couple of reports and it was a colossal failure, mainly because I have no idea how to use AutoIT. It's obviously possible to do without Alteryx, but it sure as hell is a ton easier to set up.
Correct.  I loath doing anything repeatable.
VBA to the rescue!
I've never heard of smath, I'll have to check it out. 
Lucked into it, knew some people through my dad, always had a strong computer and Excel background though. Almost failed the interview but then noticed the fantasy football postings on his wall and struck up a conversation about that which I had been playing for years and got the job.
Unfortunately I am not.  If you want to PM me, I can offer advice and maybe some tips.  The biggest tip I can give though with regards to landing the career you want, is to be willing to relocate.  

NYC is obviously the financial capital of the world, and will have the greatest amount of available jobs and overall opportunities, however it will also have the greatest amount of competition.  My career has progressed not only because of my abilities, but my willingness to relocate.
You are right, the key is "analytically-minded people", which is different here because those that i had to teach were the ones that had to model the data for their bosses and not themselves. We have a BI platform, too and me and a handful others use and love it, but most can't or don't want to learn it and thus still sometimes spend hours on building statistics manually that would take minutes by using one of the CUBEs.

I'm glad it's not the same everywhere.
I don't even know what autoIT is... Hahaha. I essentially found a very simple VBScript template to open an excel file,  run a macro, the  close the file. I have task scheduler rune the script at a set time each day. Everything else is handled in excel! 
Ah, ok. Problem was we were already using Tableau at this point. So, as far as I know at least, I wasn't able to get the VB to manipulate things on the Tableau side. 

AutoiIT is basically a script code that works outside of Microsoft. It can click the mouse and such, though I think that is a very primitive way of using it, which is why I was having issues. 
There were some pre-built data queries from IT in excel that I've modified and pieced together to fit my needs, so it's basically all excel for me! We've just upgraded SAP and there new reporting capabilities I'll have to look into, but I'll still probably feel more comfortable manipulating the data in excel haha...
