How to use a cell for data entry and simultaneously have it conditionally formatted using a formula
This would be easier to do if your test scores were already normalized into percentages. So I'm going to assume instead of a test score of 12 or 18, it actually reads 60% or 90%.

Let's say you want to apply conditional formatting to column G for rows 5 (Jonny). Highlight cell G5 and add a new rule for conditional formatting. Use this formula:

    =(G5-AVERAGE($D5:F5))/(1-AVERAGE($D5:F5))>.5

Then you can change to range to cover all of the rows needed, or just copy -> paste formats for the rest of the rows. 

AVERAGE($D5:F5) will average all test scores up to the one in the previous column starting with the first test in column D. The ">.5" tests whether the improvement is over the 50% threshhold.

Based on your definition of "improvement", the Excel formula for Jonny can be written as 
`=(G5/G$8-SUMPRODUCT(D5:F5/D$8:F$8)/COUNTA(D5:F5))/(1-SUMPRODUCT(D5:F5/D$8:F$8)/COUNTA(D5:F5))` and Emma's can be copied down from this.

You can set your conditional formatting from this, like `[above formula]>=50%`

The formula is a handful, so I'd suggest putting this into a helper cell first and triggering the conditional formatting from that cell.
I love that you taught him how to take a screen shot on a mac as well.
