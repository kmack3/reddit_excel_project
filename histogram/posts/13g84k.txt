Why use the IF function in Excel when you can use Boolean Logic?
you can then do something based on the result of your boolean expression
If, Then, Else is much easier to explain to a common user. I really only use boolean logic if I have several different criterias, or very large sets of data.

FYI, here is another link that helped me learn about boolean logic a few years back

My users don't really know what to do with TRUE and FALSE.  Gotta hand hold them a little bit and return English phrases like, "Too low" or "Too high"
Boolean is a good practice, but IFs are far easier to explain and learn before you move on to boolean.
All good comments below, but this is a good reminder for those of us who just default to if() when there might be a better way.
I'll use this for a quick comparison between 2 numbers, but aside from that, my use kinda ends.

If I'm color coding the results, I'll just sort or use a data filter then color code them; if there was a benefit to using conditional formatting, then it would still be easily accomplished, maybe an extra 5 seconds because I'm not using boolean logic?

I do see the application though for large formulas that would require more then 5 nested if statements.
You can set the logic to match multiple different criteria.
