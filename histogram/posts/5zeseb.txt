I dun spent over a year refining a spreadsheet for work. Now the company is sharing new butt-ugly low-functionality spreadsheets with us via Google Docs and telling us that's the system. Need a VBA to copy data from one to the other.
Oh oh, I might be able to help with this! Doing something similar at work. 

You save your files in a particular location. Right now it's C\June, and it's grabbing specific data and pasting it into a specific location. It can be generalized, but in that case I'd create data "landing tabs" where you can safely paste in all of the data at once, then parse it from there. 

Downloading everything from Google sheets easily, I don't know. I know Google has some interesting features in that direction

    Option Explicit

    Sub Create_Month_Summary()

    Dim folderPath As String
    Dim fileName As String
    Dim thisWorkbook As Workbook
    Dim dayNumber As Integer
    Dim workbookDate As Date
    
    'Folder containing daily dated workbooks for a month - CHANGE AS REQUIRED
    
    folderPath = "C:\Excel\June\"
    
    Cells.ClearContents
    
    Range("A1").Value = "Date"
    Range("B1").Value = "Total 1"
    Range("C1").Value = "Total 2"
    Range("D1").Value = "Total 3"
    
    Set thisWorkbook = ActiveWorkbook
    
    If Right(folderPath, 1) <> "\" Then folderPath = folderPath & "\"
    
    fileName = Dir(folderPath & "*.xls")
    Do While fileName <> ""
        
        'Parse file name to get workbook date
        
        workbookDate = CDate(Left(fileName, InStr(fileName, ".") - 1))
        dayNumber = Day(workbookDate)
        
        'Copy data from dated workbook to associated row in summary sheet
        
        Workbooks.Open folderPath & fileName
        With thisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1")
            .Offset(dayNumber, 0).Value = workbookDate
            .Offset(dayNumber, 1).Value = Sheets("Sheet1").Range("D25").Value
            .Offset(dayNumber, 2).Value = Sheets("Sheet2").Range("D26").Value
            .Offset(dayNumber, 3).Value = Sheets("Sheet3").Range("D27").Value
        End With
        ActiveWorkbook.Close savechanges:=False
        
        'Get next file name
        
        fileName = Dir
    Loop
    
    MsgBox "Finished"
    
    End Sub


I'd google "Excel VBA get data from other sheets" or some terms similar for more details

screenshot or a mock-up (in case of sensitive data) of the the layout of both sheets (which columns/data is where and needs to be copied to which columns/data where) would be mighty helpful I'm sure. 


Can I email the two workbooks to you? Because of the layout of mine, a mockup is far too complex.
I don't have time to look at it too much right now, sorry, hopefully someone else will shoot you a message
