Help bypassing forgotten password on excel worksheet
Im on my phone so cant poat a link bit if you google something like "excel vba password removal hex edit" you should find a few solutions. Basically you compress the file then open it woth a hex editor then you can break thw passwors to allow you access
similar question: what about if you can't open the file without entering a password? how do you crack it then? it's an old file, but i could still use the contents.
I was able to do this to access the VBA page and edit what I need. However, when I enter back into the spreadsheet I still get a protected sheet error when editing a cell. I was able to fully edit the VBA but not the cell content.
try to open it using OpenOffice.
I know it's not easy since you have to download and install it, but OpenOffice breaks every sheet protection i think
    Dim i As Integer, j As Integer, k As Integer
    Dim l As Integer, m As Integer, n As Integer
    Dim i1 As Integer, i2 As Integer, i3 As Integer
    Dim i4 As Integer, i5 As Integer, i6 As Integer
    On Error Resume Next
    For i = 65 To 66: For j = 65 To 66: For k = 65 To 66
    For l = 65 To 66: For m = 65 To 66: For i1 = 65 To 66
    For i2 = 65 To 66: For i3 = 65 To 66: For i4 = 65 To 66
    For i5 = 65 To 66: For i6 = 65 To 66: For n = 32 To 126
    ActiveSheet.Unprotect Chr(i) & Chr(j) & Chr(k) & _
    Chr(l) & Chr(m) & Chr(i1) & Chr(i2) & Chr(i3) & _
    Chr(i4) & Chr(i5) & Chr(i6) & Chr(n)
    If ActiveSheet.ProtectContents = False Then
    MsgBox "One usable password is " & Chr(i) & Chr(j) & _
    Chr(k) & Chr(l) & Chr(m) & Chr(i1) & Chr(i2) & _
    Chr(i3) & Chr(i4) & Chr(i5) & Chr(i6) & Chr(n)
    Exit Sub
    End If
    Next: Next: Next: Next: Next: Next
    Next: Next: Next: Next: Next: Next
    End Sub
    

Ahh I thought you didnt have access to vba. Sheet protection is really easy to get around as the password is hashed. 

Again im on my phone so xant post decent links but just google for "Unprotect worksheet macro" or similar. I belive there is also a post in the subreddits FAQ about this
no, i've tried already.
+1 point.
The removal hex thing worked perfectly! Thanks so much.
