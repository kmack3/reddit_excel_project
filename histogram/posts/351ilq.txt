250 Excel Keyboard Shortcuts
Thanks!
The Windows key has some more shortcuts too. Windows + directional keys change the position of a window on the screen and whether it's minimized or maximized. I use it all the time on wider screens to have windows tiled, or on dual screens to quickly move windows to the other screen.
I'm loving this, there are some I don't know...!
Win + Shift + left/right arrow will move it to the same position on the next screen
