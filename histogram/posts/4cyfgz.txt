I think I'm going to put this into the splashscreen of every macro driven file I create.
Great work! The ExcelTV guys are fantastic too.
I might put it in my resume
I figured it read better than - the weird guy with a full sleeve of tattoo's - drug lord pony tail and full on Amish beard who surfs Reddit constantly. Do me a favor and  do a little Application.Speach.Speek "Do you even Excel bro?"
I came upon them probably a year and some odd ago and Oz said the line that got me hook, line and sinker - "You can teach anyone to use Excel, it's the process of logical thinking that they must learn."
I just got it tattooed on my face so people will finally understand me.
Pictures or it didn't happen.
