Why doesn't there exist a proper tool for mapping in Excel yet?
Not sure if Excel itself can do this, but Google's "Sheets" and mapping tools [can do this.](https://support.google.com/mymaps/answer/3024836?hl=en)
Use power bi desktop. It's Microsoft and free.
Excel does not have a mapping tool because its to far out of scope from its original purpose.
I suggest trying QGIS, its free.
I don't have time to read everything so this may not be applicable but I thought of this based on the title:

http://www.batchgeo.com/
I've done a little bit of mapping, but only with points based on lat/longs. 

You could make a script that finds the lat/long based on address and then have a column for notes. 

ANND, interesting, while looking up how to modify hover text in excel, i found this nifty article: http://www.clearlyandsimply.com/clearly_and_simply/2010/12/better-chart-tooltips-with-microsoft-excel-2010.html
PowerView imo still has a long way to go to be a widely used BI Tool compared to software like Qlikview & Tableau and that's coming from someone who has dabbled in all 3. 

Your best bet right now is to use other software to do mappings and then import them into Excel as an image.

I think there are ways to do create more customised mappings on Excel but it'll require a bit of VBA knowledge and preparation.
I was JUST thinking of this.  I'd like to import data to a map of my state with prices "above" their addresses.  The heatmaps just really fail to convey much useful information
Just for clarification, are you trying to add multiple points to a single map, or display each address on its own map?
You can export from Excel to GIS in MapInfo Professional.
It was years ago, so I'm having trouble locating the sheet. I'll update if I find it. Regardless, it was pretty simple to write a vba script that queried yahoo for GPS data, then export an XML sheet that could be opened on Google Earth.
I think there is an extension that can do this 
I built a mapping tool one time, it displays a heat map by state.  I'm sure it could be configured to plot other ways too.  I manually created shape objects, meticulously in the shape of each state.  I also started adding in countries too.  This was to plot sales by state of my business.  Using it requires alot of VBA knowledge.  Sometimes I think about refining it and selling it
It's really not hard to turn an excel file (which is XML based) into a Google earth KML file (which is XML based).

I've written several excel formula based and VBA workbooks which take address on one sheet and spit out a KML file for google earth to open.

You can use lat and long if you have them or you can use addresses and Google earth will try to use Google search to find them.

The biggest problem is that KML doesn't like characters outside of the 26 in A to Z, so if your working with addresses in languages other than English you need a stage where you find and replace such characters.

Another tip is when you first open the KML as it has so much searching to do it can take a while. There no issue opening GE after that but if you want to send the file to someone else you're better off exporting a KMZ out of GE rather than sending your original KML.

There's also a couple of websites where you can paste an excel table and it will do this whole process but I work with client data and I'm reluctant to send that through a third party site. 
I would recommend Google fusion. It's a database table with mapping features. Very easy to upload an excel file and work with.
For large lists of addresses, you should use a geocoding service to convert to lat long and add points to some other mapping tool. Google maps is nice, but there's a limit to the number of data points you can load, the same applies to bing maps. Tableau works okay, but their mapping tools suck beyond plotting the points.

Most people want a geographic information system, GIS, which is dominated by ArcGIS, to do geospatial analysis with address and location data.
I agree with u/hswerdfe. There is no proper tool for mapping in Excel because Excel is not a GIS tool. Just because you can use add-ins that let you do rudimentary mapping doesn't mean it's the best tool for the job :)
Can't think of an excel addon but Tableau would be perfect for this. 
Excel used to have some mapping capabilities, but Microsoft stopped developing it in favor of their stand alone mapping software, Map Point, which can integrate with Excel, but not very well.

+1 for powerBI
The ArcGIS visualization in Power BI isn't bad either, and is improving pretty quickly. 
I love batchgeo - it's really good for plotting multiple locations. That's about it though, AFAIK it doesn't do heatmaps or any kind of routing. 
Power View is being phased out (it's hidden in 2016) in favour of migrating users across to the Power BI platform.
