Holding ALT when dragging an object (text box, chart), makes the edge/s you're dragging snap to cells.
Protip: The alt key is the "snapping" key across most Office programs. In powerpoint it overrides the default resizing and alignment behavior which is equally useful!
I'm pretty sure I've gone from self-appointed expert in Excel to amateurish for not knowing this! Thanks!
Mac users need to use Command for this to work. Holding down Alt will copy the chart on a Mac.

Great tip though, was not aware of this feature.



I've actually started bugging people for NOT using this - it's such a great way to make spreadsheets look amazingly neat and tidy!

Then, turn off re-sizing/moving as necessary and the buttons are always constant.
Hngh! So many hours could have been saved! Thank you for this! 
Use this a lot. Mild Excel OCD sufferer.
You just saved me a Google search. Was wondering this as I sat at my desk
Mother of god. You have saved me so much work.

I had to make [these](http://imgur.com/xcZ9zjw) look pretty on a monthly basis.
One of those functions that i need a lot, thx for this!
What is the "snapping" key you're talking about ?
Omg thank you for this info! I love and hate that feature in PPT. Good to know how to override it if I need to.

You guys should consider qlik, Tableau, domo or any other of the myriad dashboard/viz tools. So worth the investment. 
I misspoke - it's the keyboard shortcut that's commonly used to override snap-to-grid preferences in multiple office programs, not just Excel. Just wanted to share that it works in PPT as well! 
We print it out on 52 X 40 inch paper and hang it for our folks. It was looking pretty ugly before I painstakingly lined up the charts. Now it'll be easy.
