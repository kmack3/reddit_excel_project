I thought you may like this maze excel game I made.
Can't wait to try this at work tomorrow. Thanks :D ;)
Fantastic!! I admit I smirked at the end message:

> Well done, you have tried to defeat the maze. You must be pleased with yourself?

Is this like "All your base are belong to us."?

Worthy of note: the left, right, up and down keys are disabled after closing the workbook.
That would be classed as the bad ending.  There is a good ending as well.
I managed to reach that as well. Didn't even needed one of the keys.

If you are interested in mazes, you can check out my maze generator: https://github.com/AyrA/ExcelStuff

It not only generates mazes but also let's you solve them using your cursor keys. You might find some code interesting because (for example) I lack any form of key binding on the arrow keys and my cursor moves automatically until it hits a wall or a crossing.
