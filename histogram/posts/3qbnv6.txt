[Microsoft Collaboration] Excel Product Team - AMA 4th November @ 12pm ET (4pm UTC)
I am so excited! I love excel!
Why do lines not stay highlighted when the spreadsheet looses focus x_x
Some questions I'll submit (this is AMAZING news btw):

* SQL support for table data. GDocs has this and it is amazingly useful. SQLite could sort this in a sprint.
* .net scripting, compiled, fast. VBA kills me. Or EcmaScript.
* When I will be able to do "some" form of scripting in Mobile Excel - perhaps a new scripting model, not asking to support the old one, but with scripting there are so many custom "apps" I could build for mobile/tablet side.
* Coolest use of Excel they've seen.
* When the CRAZY MDI model will get fixed.
* Better options for querying RSS, REST.
* Why I can't autofilter columns by name in VBA
* more to come
Can we fix the whole can't open two excel docs with the same name?  And the weird undo applying to two files in the same time?  Can we have undo/redo branches?

Also can we PLEASE have built-in ISO 8601 DATES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.
RemindMe! 3pm Nov 4
I hope I will remember to come back with questions.

* Excel 2017, with Python scripting. Have you considered it, or something like it? VBA is many users' first contact with scripting, and it is hardly the best experience for a beginner.

* More SQL. SQL makes so good sense when juggling data. Would you include it in more places throughout Excel, such as functions? Manipulating arrays and recordsets in VBA could also benefit from SQL support.

* Excel 2013 introduced the =WEBSERVICE function which is pretty darn cool. Will we see more along those veins? Getting data from websites is a huge headache, and built-in functionality like that is a great help.

* What is the justification for keeping Power Query, Power View, etc., out of the base Excel configurations? My firsthand impression with these hasn't been great, unfortunately, as I like to stay within Excel. (competing solutions do the data handling better, and Tableau does the power viewing better)

I just want to be able to stop Excel from "Helping" when I have to open CSVs. 
Can someone please explain to me why excel has to differentiate between numbers as numbers and numbers as text?

My life would be simpler if it could just match 34125 to 34125 regardless of format.
Would very much like to know if a keyboard shortcut to highlight cells/change font colour is in the works..

I.e I have cell fill function set to the quick access toolbar, meaning I can press alt-6 to open the function, but then have to use the mouse to select the colour... Why can't the top row of colours be assigned numbers or something...

It would save so much time.

Does Excel 2016 solve the 'Excel has stopped working...' bug.  It is so frustrating to be half way thru generating a report and then Excel crashes for no apparent reason.  Excel 2013 is far too unstable, Excel needs to be much more resilient to 'unforseen issues'.
Remind me! 3pm Nov 4th

Holy shit

Question:

Realistically how many users can use the same Microsoft/Office 365 account to live co-author Excel documents in the web apps???
RemindMe! 3pm Nov 4
Where is a proper =STARTOFMONTH function and don't tell me the DAX function is sufficient because that only returns the earliest record within the column for it's records calendar month.
Seriously... why must Excel crash daily?  I have a decent machine and anytime I push excel to do any heavy lifting it just quits on me. 

On a related note the Auto Recover feature is very good and most of the time I am able to continue where I left off.
Damn I was slammed at work today and didn't get a chance to ask my question:

Why'd they murder Clippy instead of giving him a new brain!
Great work! I mean I won't have anything to ask other than "so, ummm... I hear there's stuff on Windows that there isn't on Mac...?" but I'm sure you wizards will make the most of it!
Kindred spirit!

Mind you, we're on this sub, so I guess it's to be expected.
This. Very this. 
I'm curious about your questions.

When I needed to query db's, I used ADODB with VBA. It always seemed to suit my needs, but I'm assuming this is not what you had in mind....
But MS query can run SQL and return it in a table. Not a simple solution like Google docs but it still works. 
I will piggyback onto the VBA Questions as the developer is my favourite tool in Excel by far. If they made this much more easy to navigate, much easier to find relationships between modules and made the referencing easier to use I would start using it all the time, however at the moment the basic look and basic features kill my time and kill productivity. 
> SQL support for table data. GDocs has this and it is amazingly useful. SQLite could sort this in a sprint.

Ooh, great idea.
The solution to the first problem is to open documents in two separate excel sessions. When you have an open workbook and open another through File->Open then it will be in the same session and can't have the same name. But if you first launch another instance of Excel from your operating system, then you can open anything with the same name (can even open the same file you already have, in read-only mode)
wow I never even knew the undo thing was a thing! :O
>can we PLEASE have built-in ISO 8601 DATES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.

This, absolutely. Computerized dates should be in this format by default.
The name issue is my primary gripe after they finally made opening sheets in seperate windows a standard and non awkward behavior. (I know there was ways around it but it didn't really work on our work system due to the organisation of documentation)

also curious about how the acquisition of RevolutionAnalytics (they make proprietary enterprise builds of R) might factor into future versions
for your last question, more and more of the power suite is baked into excel, and the plan is to advance that as it goes along. in 2016 you no longer have to download powerquery, map, or view, and material is starting to get published on M, that powers powerquery. 

What I'd like to see, but probably won't, is an extension to control, or at least give simple commands to, all these new aspects in Excel (like Excel Apps in 2013) with VBA. 
1&2: Or LINQ lambda syntax.

Edit: Removed accidental shouty formatting.
I hadn't thought of Excel with Python Scripting. That would be amazing.

Is there any plan to include other languages, though, like C#?

I'm just so done with VB. It's yucky, what with indices starting at 1 and its non C formatting.
That reminds me, auto Text-To-Columns. Sometimes, just give me the damned data!!
It's because while people can treat numbers as number, text, shapes, or whatever, computers have a hard time comparing things if they don't know they're the same type.  So, even if you're comparing 34125 to 000034125, if you do that as numbers, they're the same thing (though if you don't format the second one correctly, you'll lose the preceding zeroes), but if you compare them as strings (text), they're not.  Without knowing what types to use, it's hard to know how to compare them, and with a program like Excel, where accuracy of logical operations counts, you usually don't want it to "guess".
alt, H, H, (arrows to preffered colour) enter? - you could use AHK for the arrows + enter bit for other options. 
You could always design a macro to do that for you, wouldn't be too hard.
Curious what you mean by this, the graphs themselves are pretty damn simple and through a little bit of tinkering you can do a lot with them.

it's not a proper start of month function, but 

    =EOMONTH(A1,-1)+1

does the job relatively painlessly. But yeah it would make sense to have a start of month function built-in to match the end of month function that is there. 
The AMA is now live - go straight there! Link at the top.
THIS.! THIS RIGHT HERE! SO VERY THIS! 
Responded to this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/3qbnv6/microsoft_collaboration_excel_product_team_ama/cwef0dp
Yes, Excel's interaction with _other_ data is great, and much better than GDocs, but I would love to simply do:

=SQL("SELECT SUM('Amount') FROM Transactions WHERE 'Category'=$E$6" AND 'Date'<NOW() AND 'Date'>DATEADD(MONTH, -1, NOW())")

In other words, I want to query table data within the sheet, not from outside the sheet.

What I end up with instead is clonky stuff like:

={SUM(IF(Transactions[Date]>=S$1, IF(Transactions[Date]<V$1, IF(Transactions[Category]=$C20, Transactions[Amount], 0), 0), 0))}

It just isn't expressive for what I'm trying to do.
You realize you can us an ADODB connection to the workbook itself and do this right? I know its not a native ability as you are asking, but it is still VERY doable with only a little knowledge of VBA

edit: use Jet engine
If its "0653456" in the CSV leave the leading zero alone! If its "2/4" in the CSV don't give me "Feb-04" or whatever. 
Arrows to preferred colour is slow. The top row (or standard) of colours should be numbered 0-9

Ohh I know the negative one plus one all to well my friend.... I actually put together a blog post about it too haha - [Mad Maximum Value](http://itsnotaboutthecell.com/2015/06/10/mad-maximum-value/). Just upsets me they created a DAX function and I was like ABOUT TIME and I find out it really just turns the MIN date of the records Month as opposed tot he actual start of the month. Frustrating but it wouldn't be Excel if we didn't have workarounds.
I'm confused... 

So you don't want to qury a database. You want to query your own spreadsheet, using SQL syntax?
One of the things I like in GDocs is the ability to filter or query using just a formula, then using that "filtered" data as an argument. Pivots have you covered most of the time for the desired functionality in Excel, but it would still be a really neat feature to carry over. 

Also the ability for a single cell formula (like the filter or query) to push the cells below it and update dynamically. I know that's probably not going to happen ever in Excel because you risk people messing up what's already on the sheets, but I mean, if you put a big warning sticker on it, it would be super neat, a much better alternative to advanced filter -> filter in new location -> yada yada
`={SUM((Transactions[Date]>=S$1)*(Transactions[Date]<V$1)*(Transactions[Category]=$C20)*Transactions[Amount])`

Or you can use if(and(...)) or I think sumif or sumproduct.
Yep
When you're importing the data you can tell it specifically what format you want it to consider the data, instead of having it guess with the "general" setting. 
you should make sure to take this comment to the AMA (maybe in a slightly revised version :P) but one of the bigger changes for Excel 2016 (and onwards) is an entirely new charting engine to do new types of charts and over time upgrade the standard set of charts to suck less, for 2016 it's built-in box & whisker, waterfall, sunburst, treemap, and pareto chart so far. So I'm sure any in-depth questions about the charting functionality will be appreciated. 

If you have a look at the charting survey linked in the top of the sub you can see which charts are on the veritable wish-list / under consideration for the future and give your input on what you think would be the most important to change. 
Yes, exactly. I have lots of rows, I want to query these rows using SQL, like GDocs allow - 50% of all Excel work I do is about aggregating or selecting data, then building graphs on it. Why not Access, then? Because excel is better/quicker at building overviews and summaries of the data.
Converting bool to 0 makes perfect sense :) thank you, I feel slightly stupid.

I still want SQL, though ... Best example I could come up with 😉

I want to do this all the time. And also, to join two (or more) tables together. I sometimes create a local ODBC DSN. But that's not very portable.
IF you're just clicking the CSV file and it opens up in Excel automatically, you can run into a bunch of finicky little issues. 

A better way to do it is open up Excel, then go to DATA -> From Text -> select your CSV file. 

This opens up the Text Import Wizard, select Delimited, click next, then select comma, click next, now you'll get a window where you can choose between the data format. 

"General" means Excel tries to guess it, use this for regular numbers.   
"Text" imports the value as a text value, use this for things like "2/3" and account numbers (e.g. 000322402 keeping it's zeroes in the front, or very long numbers being converted to E notation).  
"Date" converts the date text in the cell into an excel date-value that, that can be calculated on, and displays it as a date. 

By clicking about in the data preview area, you can change the type for each column, or you can just make it "text" for everything if you aren't going to be using the data for any calculations. 

When you're done, you just save as -> .csv and you're golden. 

This ended up being a long'ish comment, but the process is straightforward 5-clicks-and-you're-go 
Thanks! :)
I know! It has to simply work *within* a non-macro enabled spreadsheet.
Use the Microsoft Power Query. add-in Game changer.
Have you tried the Power Query Add-In? From Excel 2016, Power Query is built in to the Data ribbon under "Get and Transform" section. It can select and join data from Excel Tables and a wide range of other sources (databases, files, websites etc). It can deliver the result as an Excel Table.

If you guys are just opening up csv files to check the contents, maybe get a third party csv viewing program? (seen CSVed mentioned a few times) 
[deleted]
ah yeah it's a bit of a different story then, best of luck with it! 
I had a bad comment. Try this for starters, easier:

Start menu, type Powershell, press enter

Import-CSV C:\filePath -Useculture | Out-Gridview

It's a start.
