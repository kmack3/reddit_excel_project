Changing the default font color on all new workbooks
Did the normal cell style get modified to change the font color?

Go to the cell style thing, right click on normal (is it red there?) then modify.  Edit the font settings to change the color.
Been awhile since I used it but I think you click the office button, and go to advanced settings under excel options. I think you can change the color there?
On first impression, I'd probably think that the startup template workbook was saved with a red font throughout.  So I'd probably save a new workbook template with all black font in the XLSTART folder.

Step 1: Create a new workbook, format the workbook as you need.

Step 2: Click the File > Save > Computer > Browse in Excel 2013, or click the File /Office button > Save in Excel 2007 and 2010.

Step 3: In the coming Save As dialog box:

 * Name the new template as Book in the File name box;

 * Click the Save as type box and specify the Excel Template (*.xltx) from the drop down list;

 * Remove the saving path in the Address box, and then paste the following path into the Address box and press the Enter key.
   C:\Documents and Settings\%username%\Application Data\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART

 * Click the Save button.

Step 4: Restart Excel
Hm, it's already set to black. I just realized that even though the font button on the ribbon shows red, the text is black when I type. Any ideas on how to change the default color on the font button?

No, I've checked. It's not under advanced options. 
You mean the font button up on the ribbon/menu?  It is always an A with a red underline, that is so it stands out in the UI as the place you change colors.  Same in 2007, 2010, 2013, etc.
