How to Make an American Flag in Excel
Actually, there are several useful Excel tips in that trick!
Yes, I know it is a relatively useless trick, but I don't have any fireworks.
Very cool, i saw a few things on the tutorial that could be useful in other spreadsheets!
minor point: in your conditional format you had `=mod(row(),2)=1`. You don't need it to evaluate to `TRUE/FALSE` as long as it evaluates to `1/0`, respectively!
I enjoyed that. I'll be using conditional formatting now when Monday rolls around. 
You are so cool!! I love your gifs :)
Awesome! You should repost to /r/murica
Could someone explain in a step-by-step way how they did that?
Really nice tricks with the conditional formatting to blank out the alternate stars, and the alternate stripes!
This is exactly the sort of messing about in Excel that helps you learn new tricks. Love it.
You get a [**FUCK YEAH**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhnUgAaea4M)!
Good point, thanks. I tend to flip back and forth between doing this and not doing it.  Old habits die hard. Definitely good to keep formulas as short as possible.  
I did it, what the hell.  Not sure they will appreciate it as much as r/excel, but you never know.  
1. Format columns A1 to K11 with a Width of 4.43 and a height of 19.5 (adjust by right clicking the column or row heading while selected)
1. Set background to Blue and font color to white
1. Insert Symbol from Insert Ribbon; Choose Wingdings and you can find the star (I used a size 17 font)
1. Highlight every other column and row conditionally by using ISODD(ROW()+Column()) and use the number format of ;;; to hide cells where that is an odd number (builds your array of 50 stars)
1. Use the camera tool to capture the range of A1 to K11 and then select the 2nd tab to put an image of the range into
1. Adjust your row height on the second tab so that your array of stars fits into the first 7 rows
1. Use =MOD(ROW(),2)=1 on the stripes area to color each row Red


I liked it at least and I learned some skills too
