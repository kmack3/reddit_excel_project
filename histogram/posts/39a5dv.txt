When using VLOOKUP Function can I stop excel from putting #N/A in the empty spaces?
Yes, use IFERROR

=IFERROR(***VLOOKUP goes here*** , ***value you want instead of #N/A here***)

EDIT: If you want to be more specific, you can use =IFNA, which does the same thing, but for #N/A only. i.e. It won't hide "**#DIV/0!**"
I'm pretty sure you can use an if statement and ISNA to have it fill in blank instead. Something like. 
=if(isna(your-vlookup),"",your-vlookup)
As others have stated, you can use IFERROR, sometimes though you want to allow errors to see if you forgot to put a number in some of your fields. In that case you could use this (I assume your product-name is in column A):

    =IF(A2="";"";VLOOKUP)

You are the best, thank you! 
This.
This is hands down my most frequently used formula at work. I always find myself putting in "double check cell" or similar so I can go back and verify what happened later on if needed. Has saved me on several occasions. 
If the OP is using Excel 2003 or earlier, the IFERROR function is unavailable, and this is their only option.  (Though personally, I'd use ISERROR instead of ISNA.)

Yep. Every single one at work goes this way so I can paste values immediately afterwards.
Good to know. Thanks. 
Also, that can double the required vlookups. Slows down on large data sets
