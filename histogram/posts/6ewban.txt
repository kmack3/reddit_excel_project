Trying to export data to another sheet
What do you mean "I cannot filter my data with that"? You can certainly record filtering data.
But it will be the same keystroke everytime if i record a macro doing that 

Are you filtering by something different every time? Perhaps try using and recording an [Advanced Filter](http://www.contextures.com/xladvfilter01.html). You could manually set the criteria and then run the macro.


Yes filtering data for different periods during a financial year 

You sir are a saving grace
I tried that and it worked...:D

Is there a way for me to retain the format? 
And also can it not be automated? 
Thanks for posting that link.
How can i give a date range as criteria? 

I tried selecting 2 cells for date range 03-01-2017 to 06-01-2017...but it didnt work...also tried >03-01-2017 and <06-01-2017...but no luck
You can just record a macro where you run the Advanced Filter -- in the future all you'd need to do is change what's in the criteria range and run the macro.

You can take the formatting from the original and apply it to the new one. Add this to the macro, make sure you fill in the correct sheet names

          Sheets("Original Sheet Name").UsedRange.Copy
          Sheets("New Sheet Name").Range("A1").PasteSpecial xlPasteFormats


3/1/2017 and <6/1/2017 will work. You need to create a separate heading for each criteria, then select the whole range for your criteria in the advanced filter:

Date|Date|
:--|:--|
3/1/2017 |6/1/2017|
