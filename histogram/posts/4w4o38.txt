Microsoft fully releases the Excel API
Looks like this only applies to Excel 365, like you can't use it with local files?

Nope, it sounds pretty neat though, depending on how hard it is to use. I guess I'm not really enough of a developer to think about what I'd use it for, but I suppose if you have some sort of advanced workbook, that might not be used enough to warrant some re-programming, you could still use it as a basis for a web-calculation.
Well. This looks excellent. At once they've entered a new market, have a large user base, and (hopefully) have lowered the threshold of experience necessary for some of the 'heavy-lifting' tasks. 

Bookmarked. Thanks OP.
Hmm, I'm not holding my breath, but if I could easily refresh the data in the workbook stored in SharePoint lib and rendered through Excel Web Services... 
I think that's right, not sure. The blog post specifically mentions Office 365 as you picked up. I won't get a chance to tinker in the next few weeks, hopefully someone else can enlighten us.
Some of their sample apps spell out an Office 365 pre-requisite. Guessing that's right too.
This is actually awesome for me as an Office365 admin.

Thanks, OP.
That'd be cool. I've got too many other things going on right now, but I hope I remember to look around at this later.
