Taking figures from one workbook and averaging them on another
Try this: 

> =AVERAGEIF(['C:\Users\ExcelAssistanceReq\Workbook1.xls']!A:A,"="&B4,['C:\Users\ExcelAssistanceReq\Workbook1.xls']!E:E)

If you want to add the sheet name, use this:

    =AVERAGEIF('C:\Users\ExcelAssistanceReq\[Workbook1.xls]Sheet1'!A:A,"="&B4,'C:\Users\ExcelAssistanceReq\[Workbook1.xls]Sheet1'!E:E)
Thank you for helping! This gave me a #VALUE error, which is a step in the right direction. I got rid of the top row which had headings I don't need, but it still was #VALUE. Any thoughts?

I tried it in an actual excel file and it seems to work. Here's an example. You may just replace the filename/column names.

I figured it out; it was because I had the 2 workbooks open in separate instances. When I opened them both in one instance of Excel, it worked properly. Thank you!!
Thank you, I typed it in with exactly the format you have in your screenshot, but it's still coming up #VALUE. From what I understand, #VALUE is when the cells don't have numbers in them so it can't do math. I selected the columns and made sure they were formatted as Numbers, but that didn't help either. Here is the actual formula, with actual file names:

    =AVERAGEIF('C:\Users\Moreilly\[Stretch Plus Audit History.xls]StoreInv'!$A:$A,"="&$B4,'C:\Users\Moreilly\[Stretch Plus Audit History.xls]StoreInv'!$E:$E)


Everything in Columns A and E on the referred-to XLS sheet is a number, so what else could be making it #VALUE?
You're welcome. Glad to be able to help.
