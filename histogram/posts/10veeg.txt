Excel Shortcuts Galore!!
woo! link approved!
Very nice find indeed. Thank you.
Most of these lists are fairly repetitive. There's actually a few good finds in here that I didn't have in my repertoire before.

Cool, thanks for that.  I've met most of these at one time or another, but it's nice to have a refresher :)

A Keyboard shortcut that I use quite often, but isn't on the list, is my CTRL-e.  I wrote a custom function that kills duplicate entries in your selection (and is undo-able).  Sooo handy!

Theres this kind of interesting conflict, or duality, between Pre and post 2007 alt keys and then functions.  The pre 2007 stuff is barely documented now unfortunately.

For example:  To open the Range Naming dialog.
2003: Alt, i, n, d  (I use this one still! Insert, Name, Define)
2007: Alt, m, n    (maybe easier to remember, but old habits...)
Function:  CTRL + F3   (Huh, who knew?)
I consider my self pretty good with excel, but there are stuff in here that is blowing my mind...

Ahem, there are native shortcuts to set borders. O.O Oh My Fucking God.
In the [master workbook](http://excelexposure.com/workbook/) on my site. I have a lot of Excel shortcuts listed in an Excel spreadsheet with categories and experience level designations.  It also has a list of all functions with syntax and many example sheets to go along with the video lessons.
Brilliant.  Timesaver supreme!!
Oh, and I should note, they still have an incomplete list, with all of that said. There's a few quick keys that I use frequently (those are the ones that use the hotkeys referenced when you hit `Alt` and key combos pop up on the ribbon)

`Alt+o` then `h t` Open the tab color dialog  
`Alt+h` then `v v` Paste values  
`Alt+a` then `t` turn on filtering for currently selected range, or region if only one cell is selected.  
Multiple selections with only the keyboard? Yes please!! Shift + F8

I have wondered how to do that for ages now.
That is pretty fantastic.
