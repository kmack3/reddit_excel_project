Issue reg. export of several worksheets into pdfs
What you are going to want to do is a For Each Loop on the Worksheets...

Something along the lines of

    Option Explicit
    
    Sub WorksheetWorker()
        
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        
        For Each ws In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
            'Do Stuff here...
        Next ws    
    End Sub


This basically says, for each Worksheet... do whatever you want, go to the next worksheet, and do the same thing... 
That makes sense and seems like a great way to account for multiple sheets! Thanks a lot!  But I unfortunately still have the issue of naming and saving the pdfs correctly. Do you have any ideas for that?

Of course, give this a go:

    Option Explicit
    
    Sub WorksheetWorker()
        
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        Dim strFolder As String, strFileName As String
        
        With Application.FileDialog(msoFileDialogFolderPicker)
                .AllowMultiSelect = False
                .Show
            On Error Resume Next
                strFolder = .SelectedItems(1)
            Err.Clear
            On Error GoTo 0
        End With
        
        For Each ws In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
            strFileName = ActiveWorkbook.Name
         ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Filename:=strFolder & "\" & ActiveWorkbook.Name & " - " & ActiveSheet.Name _
         , Quality:=xlQualityStandard, IncludeDocProperties:=True, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, OpenAfterPublish:=False
        Next ws

    End Sub

Long story short, going to open a "folder picker" that will allow you to pick where you want the file saved.

Then it wall save the file in that location with the Workbook Name + the ActiveSheet, since you are looping through the entire workbook... should be a quick add... 
Thanks once again.. I tried running the macro but ran into two issues:

1. The selection of where to save will prove a huge hassle in the long run as there is over 300 excel docs. Do you know the formula for just saving it in the same folder as the excel file?


2. It only saves the 1st first and does not continue with the next couple of sheets.
> It only saves the 1st first and does not continue with the next couple of sheets.

Doh!  Fixed and done... 

    Option Explicit
    
    Sub WorksheetWorker()
    
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        Dim strFolder As String, strFileName As String
    
    
        For Each ws In ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
            ws.Select
            ActiveSheet.ExportAsFixedFormat Type:=xlTypePDF, Filename:=Application.ActiveWorkbook.FullName & " - " & ActiveSheet.Name _
            , Quality:=xlQualityStandard, IncludeDocProperties:=True, IgnorePrintAreas:=False, OpenAfterPublish:=False
        Next ws
    
    End Sub
    

This is perfect!!!!!!!
