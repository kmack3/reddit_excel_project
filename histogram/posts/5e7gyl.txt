Wth are these weird green arrows? They're NOT the error trace arrows, and they're slowing my sheet down a lot!
Is it conditional formatting?

Are they shapes? eg from Insert -> Shapes ->triangle or something

I think the cursor would normally change when you mouse over them though. Is the sheet protected at all? That could be preventing you from selecting them.
Try ALT + H + E + F?
Those usually are a warning from Excel that a formula isn't consistent with others around them, or that numbers are stored as text, or any other of a bevy of warnings.  Hover over the cell and typically there is a helpful warning telling you what is going on.
YOU HAVE FAILED THIS SPREADSHEET
They were shapes :| thanks though!
I'm really curious about this.  If it's a shape or some object along those lines, then maybe this will help:

F5 > Special > Objects > OK > Delete

Ok I added the link to the file (updated in the post). And in the course of it, discovered that they are shapes: Very small arrows..... !   

So I couldn't select it. but /u/pnwsoutherner special selection dialog helped.  
 How do I give you both clippy points?
This is a useful shortcut.  Thanks for posting.  I only recently learned of ALT shortcuts and keep expanding my muscle-memories archives every day.

Nope bro that's not it. You're talking about error trace arrows and they're on the upper right side of the cell. This is on the upper left side, and the shape is different too (check the pic). Also nothing happens when you hover over the cell.   
  
I've been using Excel extensively for several years now and I've never seen something like this before.

Yours was a good post, got people thinking and made people aware of stuff they didn't know. I got two PMs about the arrows in conditional formatting, one from a regular with over 100 clippy points both saying they didn't know about that feature.

Alts are epic

Alt + H + AC
Alt + H + 9 or 6

Are probably the ones I use the most
Thanks. And yeah conditional formatting is still a pretty rarely known feature.
I never knew about them either! How do you get them in?

Alt+H+6 is new to me, I like that one.  The other two are probably my most frequently used ones as well.  Those plus Alt+H+O+I and Alt+H+O+U+H.
Home tab > Conditional Formatting (default location is in the middle) > Icon sets
Alt HOI is also clutch. I only resort my mouse about every 5 minutes now.
