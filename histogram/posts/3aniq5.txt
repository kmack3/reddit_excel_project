Welcome to /r/Excel!
I saw that it was trending, why did that suddenly happen?
I joined a few days ago, as an intermediate excel user and general tinkerer I hope to learn a few things and share my knowledge. 
I was excited to see this sub as trending, and now I have learnt about INDEX/MATCH. Thanks /r/excel!
Yeah I subscribed here because of the best of post. I'm a biochemist and use excel and minitab a lot. Poked around and saw a lot of useful stuff so I subbed.
Also, if you're just joining, make sure to check out the only post that has more upvotes than the Sumif post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2jtd2f/worked_on_a_completely_locked_down_machine_time/). It's one of the best instances of what can be done with Excel.
First time visitor. I am here to become an awesome statistician, who makes awesome statistical analysis on just about everything there is to make statistics about in daily life. Is this the right place to become a master?
I subscribed here because it was trending. I look forward to the awesome advice. 
There was an /r/bestof (a default subreddit) post about the guy who didn't know about sumif()
Because we were suddenly *awesome*.

And also consistently awesome. 
Good on you! 
You should check out /r/askstatistics and econometric/statistics software subreddits

/r/SAS

/r/stata

/r/SPSS (this software is for noobs tho)


Excel is like a Swiss Army Knife. It can do anything, and many of those well, and some perfectly. Statistics is one of those that it does pretty good.

But like a Swiss Army Knife, excel is not the best tool all the time. 

Excel's biggest benefit is that it's so prevalent and handy. And relatively easy to use. But it is not always the best tool for every job. 

In short, excel is very useful for statisticians, but ultimately I think tools like SPSS or R become essential. I recommend using excel as well as these other tools; I think it may be expected. 
Link?

I worked as a dev on Excel at Microsoft and didn't even think about joining this until I saw the bestof. Let's just say I love Excel. :)
Dont forget /r/rstats the best stats software :)

Alright developer. What's your favorite (or top 3 if you can't choose) Excel thing(s)?
Cool hope we can interest you enough to stick around
Hope to learn a few things from you!
tried to find /r/r but it didnt exist... :p
Lmao... seriously... this exists?
The amazing recalculation engine that so many people never even think about because it works so well - that code is tight. :)
Oh I will. :)
Yea they really missed out on that
Yeah, a bunch of these movies have been coming out lately.
Can help ELI5 what that means? Thanks.
Shit. I didn't think about it. Probably because it works so well. :-P

Now I want to see it haha. 
Ha, funny. You are vewy funny.
When you have a bunch of formulas in an excel spreadsheet and you change one value in a cell, Excel has a feature called auto-recalculation that goes through and updates all other formulas in the sheet that depend on the cell you changed. It can do this over many layers, on very complicated formulas, and is very efficient.  So let's say you have A1 set to 3,  A2 set to A1 + 1 and A3 set to A2 + 3.  When you change A1 to 4, A2 will automatically get changed to 5 and A3 changed to 8. :)
Oh see. I never thought it was that huge. I just thought that it is what it is supposed to be. And it works perfectly. Do other spreadsheet software's recalc engine not as tight?
I haven't compared it to others, but it's essential for the entire spreadsheet to work correctly and Excel does this well and has for a very long time.
