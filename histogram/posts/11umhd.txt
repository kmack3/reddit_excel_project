Python+Excel : Coursera is offering a free class in computational investing that uses these 2
Let me just say Python + Excel is a match made in heaven for data analysis. Python has robust modules for reading/writing CSV format and a native "list" type that is perfect for storing Excel rows and columns. I've seen several difficult reformatting problems presented on this subreddit that would be brain-busting problems for VBA, but the work of 20 minutes in Python.
Is this an online offering?
Nice! Shall check this out.

Hmm - it seems that the modeling and system will come far into the the 8th week of the project.

Rest of it seems straightforward (and of course its not going to be that way once things start)

Interesting, I have yet to hear about how excel and python work together -- So saying I want to transition from VBA to learn a new programming language.  Would you say Python is the 'next  logical step'?  If not, what would you suggest?  


Yes, just signed up.
