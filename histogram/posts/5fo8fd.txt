Excel Art
I do a similar thing, but color individual cells instead: http://i.imgur.com/uhKDWbO.png
This is EXCELlent.

He really excelled.
Think how awesome that would be in VBA with screen updating on.

I've made fractal art coloring cells using vba and math....how did you make dodge?  Really cool!
It really is.
Wolframs theory of everything is trying to explain how everything reacts by looking at it in terms of a 3D spreadsheet and looking at how it all joins together.

I did that once with the dragon curve: http://i.imgur.com/M2Klz4P.png

I wrote an application a while ago that zooms in into a small region of an image. I modified that later on so it shows Excel coordinates instead and reduces the amount of colors. You can then click on a color and it will list all cells you have to copy this over. I also have a paint macro that allows me to color cells by just clicking them.

Images with patterns are the easiest. I di the entire hoenn map (Pokemon RSE) in 1:1. This went surprisingly easy, because the map has a grid layout and allows you to copy most of the stuff. Even though it is massively larger, it went a lot easier than the mona lisa.
I would really love to see that macro. 
I'm still not sure what the heck you did...but it sounds deliciously geeky.  nice work
