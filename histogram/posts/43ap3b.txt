How to make a perfectly formatted Waterfall Chart even if you don't have Excel 2016
Really, this isn't how you should do it. This doesn't account for crossing 0, and having to custom format for the "blue bars" that are actually invisible is going to mean everything get's messed up if you need to add data to the chart.

A much better way is to use [Peltier Tech's up-down bars technique (second part of the article)](http://peltiertech.com/excel-waterfall-charts-bridge-charts/) which works fine crossing 0, retains custom formats properly if you need to add data, and means you can actually use a name that means what it says for your table's column names.
Purdy. What happens when they shut off the falls though? How will that affect coffee sales in 2016?
This should be a template or pro-tip. /r/Excel mods?
I looked through what you made, not bad, I think. 
One more good tool creating different charts, including waterfall is https://zebra.bi/features/ - I use it as an irreplaceable addition to my Excel documents.

I am pretty new to reddit. What do you mean?
~~Oh just a misguided reference to the US government talking about turning off Niagara Falls to install a few "islands" for tourists.~~

**EDIT** and this is why you should reply in the thread instead of from the inbox. I missed the context and thought you were replying to my other post.
It's not so much reddit-specific but specific to this subreddit. Next to your post there's a little "flair" that says "pro-tip" ([explanations are in the side-bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/wiki/flair)). 

Pro-tips are generally reserved for tips / hints / neat little tricks. User Templates are for full templates / workbooks that can be used by others. There's also the category we reserve for a lot of the material that points outside of reddit - "advertisement".

In this case Pro-tip is probably the most relevant as for the content of your blog post, but strictly speaking, as it links to an external site where there's a little side-pop-up about joining the course and saving money etc. etc. and none of the content of how to do any of what the pro-tip is about is reproduced in the body of the post, I'm liable to tag it as an advertisement rather than a pro-tip.   
It may be an amazing post, but it's still a link to an external site where you can (hopefully!) monetizing traffic.   
It is important to emphasize that links to your external stuff are very welcome here, and advertisement isn't meant in a negative way at all, it's just to flair the type of thread so people know what they're clicking on, and it's not like we had any complaints about this being flaired wrong at all.  
We're always happy when people share their efforts and tips with the community, even more so when they actively participate afterwards! :D
