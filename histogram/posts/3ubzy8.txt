[Trending] /r/excel is trending today! (26th Nov)
I think there was a "must know computer tricks" thread yesterday that might be the reason.
I just discovered this place yesterday. I've read through 20-30 awesome threads, learned a ton, and even asked a new question and got a great answer from /u/inmateAle. This subreddit is great!
such a helpful community
Yay!
I guess there are some workaholics skipping the feast prep 
Why is it trending?
Indeed it was.
Out of interest, did you get an AutoModerator message when you made your post?
Yes! Reminded me to add flair and gave me a few links!
Awesome, let me know if anything should be different!
