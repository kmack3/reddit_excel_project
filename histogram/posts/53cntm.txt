Create specific chart in excel
The easiest way to mimic this in Excel is to use two bar charts, with the left chart having either negative numbers or a reversed horizontal axis.

It might be possible to do this only in a single chart, but it will take a bit of work.

thanks didnt think about just doing two, that will make this easier! Never made a chart with excel but I think I will figure. How do you align them in a parallel way?
This is not precisely what you are trying to do, but the principles are similar.

Easiest way to align is to make sure they're of the same height. Then, hold ctrl and click on a chart. You can now use your arrow keys to nudge it around and thus align precisely.
You can also set the exact dimensions of the chart on the Chart Tools | Format ribbon.

Nice reference to the chart instructions BTW!
