Just automated 4 hrs of my day
Just don't tell your boss now! 
Don't hold back the glory.. what did you do ? :)
I have 8 hours of work automated and It's one of my deepest darkest secrets...
What process did you automate? 
can you share?
Sweet! Did that the last few months, have now automated a workload of around 20 hours per week that has since increased to about 40 hours of work per week.

If you want to expand: look into PowerShell and how it can connect with Excel, the web and different reportings. Saved a lot of time for me.
Welcome to the brotherhood. Congratulations and good work!
Ah the days of having Excel macros triggered via VBScripts.
Amen. I showed a coworker how to automate most of their reports. We saved so much time they were let go (running the reports was 90% of their job) and the few hours it still took to run reports were added to my workload. Lose-lose. (I got a big bonus that year, but no pay raise, and someone I didn't hate lost their job)
... or have a *very* good plan for how to add value to the role with the extra four hours.
The first rule of automation is you don't talk about automation at work
The second rule of automation is you don't talk about automation at work
The third rules is if a process times out or loops you debug
The fourth rule is no talking to it about how you did it.
The fifth and final rule is if you have Excel you must automate. 
Word is mum
I literally came here to say that. It is ridiculously important that OP not tell anyone at work. Because then bossman will start to wonder if he can automate all 8 hours.... if you follow.
Guess he wrote a macro to block Reddit on his Browser.
Basic file downloading and parsing. Searches for file names based on conditions in a sheet. Dates key words etc. Then runs a access macro for feeding a database and then runs about ten types of analysis on said data then emails the results to interested parties
Ok. Story time.  I took over a desk a few years back.  The guy before me was a friggin excel genius.  He had everything running with Macros and input pages and forms...... He spent a few days training me.   Then he dropped the "Those giant binders are the budgets".....and the files are on the shared drive.  "You have a few months to figure them out, so I won't train you".  Come budget time I figured out why.   They thought he spent two full months consolidating and preparing the budget.  It took like three days with all the automation he had built. He had them snowed.  I kept up the charade. 
His redditing, which used to be 5 hours of his workday is now reduced to 1. It is now automated by VB-scripts and posts shit-posts based off a huge database of phrases from /r/circlejerk
Its so unique it would Id me. But let's just say I have Excel running querys from a SQL server and messing with access 
My work blocks powershell but part of my automation is in batchfiles. Going old school
Those damn immigrants taking our jobs! 
That's a very real danger in our line of work.  I've seen it a few times.  I'm really enthusiastic about making processes more efficient, so it's sometimes hard to keep in mind that I may be getting people fired with my little projects.

Sadly most of the people I care about here have already been fired and their work sent to Mexico or India, so it's a bit less of a concern nowadays.
this is why you show your coworker only with an agreement that they would work 10% of the time and the other 90% to browse through reddit. I automated my workflow and now I'm on reddit. Haven't teach my co-worker yet because of this right here lol. 
Don't feel bad, I automated around 12 people at my old job (with VBA clicking stuff in IE). It should have been done with C# (eventually was), but it was ok for what it was worth. Thankfully, no-one got fired, people just got different assignments. I only got a lousy pay increase (15-20%, small bonus) and I eventually decided to move out of the country.
Unfortunately this is typical of corporate greed. 
Really your fault for not better-leveraging: you should have got his work *and* his salary.
Coworker should have sold their skill to other teams and increase their value to the business. 

Although letting someone go who is self driven and wants to introduce efficiency is very short sighted. 

That is the sort of person they want in any business.
That plan had better add about 5 hours of value in those 4 hours.
Call me old fashioned, but I yearn for the days when a man took pride in his shitposts. 
Ahh yes, the age old automate my shitposting for more valuable reddit time.
Shit that's what I need to do. 
I just do the same :D, sometime with VBS, sometime with Excel...also, I generate emails to be sent out. Scheduled daily reports, monthly reports etc...  
It's so cool to automate those things, I even had to wrote a macro that wrote a macro.
> I'm really enthusiastic about making processes more efficient, so it's sometimes hard to keep in mind that I may be getting people fired with my little projects.

I fell ya. I'm a chemical engineering student, so the ultimate end goal of my entire field could almost be described as trying to make ourselves redundant (in one sense at least).
How is this bad?  The company now wastes less and is more competitive.  If they are smart they will reinvest the money in a way to help them earn even more.  This will allow them to hire others to do more useful work instead of stupid work.  Perhaps they will hire an advertising or marketing agency with the money, employing more people.  Saving your company money is not a bad thing it should be your goal.  Yes it is unfortunate for the person who lost their job but really they shouldn't have had that job to begin with.  Hoarding knowledge is always bad for everyone in the company and you aren't protecting anything long term if you hide progress, you are hurting your company and everyone's employment.  Do you think your competitors are sabotaging their firms in order to save one job?

I know that now, I wish I had known it then.

are you a web developer? what langage?
I'd like to know more about the macro that wrote a macro... I've been wondering about something like that for some time
It's bad because human capital is a thing. When companies slash someone with experience on the specific business operation, just because work was automated, they loose all the experience from that person.  

The idea that "if work gets automated, anyone can do it" is very short sighted. 

Someone that's worked several years in a company will have an understanding of the inner workings, specific details, external factors that affect it, etc. No newly hire or robot will have that "intuition".

Freeing up some work doesn't mean get rid of people, it means you can now use those people for less menial tasks, not loose human capital, and **get more work done with the same resources**. 

Otherwise, it's just **the same work done, with less resources** aka coorporate greed.
Shouldn't the inventor of a method or system profit off of it? If the company is so great they can investigate, create and use these methods all on their own. And they will probably pay a metric ton for it.
We don't have the infrastructure to support the rate of automation and increased efficiency. Look at the productivity increase since the 1970s and look at the wages. Hes saying he got rid of a whole person's job which is great for the company but what are we doing to reuse that labor capital? When the demand for labor capital for that individual was wiped it was a big loss to the community because of economic multipliers. |-40k| to individual * multipliers > |+10k| to another individual * multipliers
It's bad because somebody lost their job. Yeah, it's good on the macro level but it's unfortunate to forget the human impact.
It's bad because the automated work still requires human employee oversight and attention and that is usually passed onto someone who's already overloaded with their own work and they are given nothing in return. The company saves money, but the worker just gets more work without pay.
I think you would find [this free online novel ]( http://marshallbrain.com/manna1.htm) about the scary possibilities of automation fascinating.

The book is an easy read, a little slow at first, but if you make it past chapter 2, it will blow your mind with what may be coming down the pipe in the near future.

 
No, I'm not a web developer.
Basically it fill a sheet with data and then add a VBA Module and write a macro in it. Since you've access to each line of code via VBA you could write polymorphic algorithm that changes itself if needed.
That makes the assumption that the human capital in question was valuable. 

I've automated many, many people out of jobs. In the instance where their experience was useful (capital) they were repurposed for other tasks. In the cases they weren't, they were forced to find other means of employment. 

If a company ends up losing capital that's otherwise worth it, they'll (eventually) be outmanuvered in the market. It's not greed, it's stupidity. Although I suppose they're remarkably similar.

In the short term, I agree, but I'd like to add that infrastructure starts with the people that form it.

We can't say *we're not ready* for automation if we're not doing anything to *get* ready. People doing uncreative work, or performing labor that will be automated over the next 10-20 years NEED to be working on their skills in other areas. Get online and get educated, or get left behind.

Sure, there will be growing pains, and some people simply don't have the willpower to change, but in the long run automation will make things 1000x better and it's our own job to make sure we still *have* a job when the times comes.
This isn't a valid argument because you have no actual evidence of the automation doomsday. This is called the Luddite fallacy. 
Agree wholeheartedly.
I've found a new project to google. Thanks!
Paying someone to automate is just a part of business. Automating your *own* job and then telling your boss is, and I'm being polite, fucking retarded.
Hey thanks, I appreciate it, I will add to my collection for later consumption. I read Rise of the Robots by Martin Ford and I enjoyed that one.
Hey I want everything to be automated lol. Dont get me wrong, I am a proponent for technology and growing your individual skills (I want to continue education). I just like playing devil's advocate. However I think it is not just short term. I think a certain amount of responsibility rests on the government, too.
My evidence is in the stagnation of wages vs. productivity from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics
It's not if you've made yourself valuable enough to keep on doing other tasks. I've done it several times in my current job, going on 10 years now. My boss loves me, I got his back (not wasting resources, RCT) and he's got mine.

Haha I'm very much the same - always looking for counterarguments and trying to view things from both sides. 

Yeah I would agree it's govt's job to make sure the transition is favorable for as many people as possible. Too bad it's not a priority for more of them - healthcare alone would save 10s of Billions by standardizing, digitizing, and automating how they process their records! Too bad the infrastructure isn't quite there yet.

Crazy, though, how that never comes up when the U.S. debates on Obamacare vs. Republicare... :/
I'd really love to hear how you came to that conclusion considering that in no way is explained by automation. 
You've automated writing code? I'm being sarcastic of course.

I'm an Econ grad and I write automation, so this is more than just entertainment to me. It's both my background and career.
