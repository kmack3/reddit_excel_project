Would anyone else want a Mr. Excel AMA?
Yes, that would be awesome :)
Yes please.  CreditsOnTheRight.
Good idea.

You might also send the ExcelTV guys your questions for him when he's on their YouTube show
Fawk yea
> Bill Jelen, aka Mr. Excel

No idea who that is.
He's the founder of Mr.Excel.com. He does excel trainings/podcasts. He's kind of a celebrity in the world of Excel.
Founder of one of, if not the, most popular Excel community.
> He's the founder of Mr.Excel.com

That site doesn't exist.  
  
Also - I've never heard of him...
It's www.mrexcel.com. The forum has a lot of helpful people.
Sorry, it's [mrexcel.com](http://www.mrexcel.com). For Excel, I regard it as one of the best forums out there, at par with [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/). 

Like I said, he's well known in the world of Excel (which is not too big really). I've heard him appear as a guest on several podcasts and seen his name on several blogs, but that's about it. 

To be honest, I'm not interested in this AMA since I don't know how it would help; we have Google.
