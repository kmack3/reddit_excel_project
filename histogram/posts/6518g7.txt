[Meta] Does anyone else get a huge influx of /r/excel posts on their front page feed every so often?
If you're subscribed to more than 50 subreddits, you front page doesn't show all of them, it shows 50 random ones. If excel happens to be among these, you will see an influx, same with other small subreddits.

This is especially noticeable if you are subscribed to a lot of dead subreddits.
I'm pretty sure that the way your front page works is that reddit picks N subreddits and populates your front page entirely from those. Not sure what N is but I think it's like 30? And I think that limit increases or goes away if you have reddit gold. 

I have no source for any of this but it's what I've read before. 
Happens to me too.
Not to me. Would be interested to know what you're subscribed to. I have this issue with many of my subs that are small but very active. Wicked edge, blade smith, whiskey, and ultralight would take over my feed if I didn't have so many subs. 

Edit: I'm now seeing what you're saying a bit on my feed. I imagine most people submitting questions do so at work and maybe wednesdays and mondays have particularly heavy traffic or something resulting in reddits algorithm preferentially showing these. 
Same, also curious
This post was on my front page, so, yeah, I guess so.
Yes. And on those days I feel like an Excel wizard.
Yep, but I like it.
Me too.
It makes me want to unsubscribe 
50 for non-gold users
With gold it goes up to 100
But you ain't got none of them sweet sweet ClippyPoints.

Someone neglecting your helping?
Or you can pay for reddit gold

Ha ha, no, I meant just reading numerous Excel tips makes me feel like I'm a spreadsheet wizard.
