I made a video tutorial about creating dashboards in Excel. What do you think?
PLEASE DO MORE!

There are precious few people who can teach well. Fewer still can develop professional quality video.

(The subtle music in the background was a nice touch, by the way.)
I didn't know about slicers before, they are pretty cool. You said they were added in 2010, any idea what happens if someone using 2007 opens the file?
Very nice! I can't wait until my work upgrades from Office 2007 to 2010.
Thank you! I was hoping of doing something similar with some data I have and this video will be very helpful. 
Echoing all of the other comments on here, this was a great video. Pivot tables always sounded like a really powerful tool, but were very intimidating from reading some text tutorials. Your video showed how easily they can be made to some complex tasks, I thank you for the knowledge.
That is very very good. Keep up the good work!
I found the video very informative. Thanks for taking the time to make it!
Thanks everyone for all your great feedback! I will make another one soon.
Awesome video!
Agreed!
Unfortunately Excel 2007 will just show blank rectangles where the slicers should be.
Mine just did. Woohoo.
