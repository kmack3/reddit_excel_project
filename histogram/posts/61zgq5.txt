Copy/Fill Options Replaced After Dragging Down
Workaround: Right Click on the bottom right corner and drag down, choose fill with formatting.
I agree with u/excelfiend93 if you Right Click on the bottom corner and drag down it work for me.  I think this change happened with 2016, but could be wrong.
When I first fill, I get the left-side behavior, based on your screenshot. When I reselect what I filled, I get the right-side behavior. 

Are your coworkers filling and then immediately seeing the formatting options, or reselecting what they've filled?
How do you do the filling? If i use a keyboard shortcut for filling i get the right-side behavior. If i drag the cell with the mouse i get the left-side behavior.
This does work - thank you! Solution Verified!
If referring to the right click option, it works from version 2010 as this is what i am unfortunately using.
They're immediately seeing the formatting options - the options on the left don't come up at all.
