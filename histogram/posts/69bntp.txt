How do you divide a number by the number of days remaining in the month?
Use this formula to work out how many days are left in the month.

    =EOMONTH(Today(),0)-Today()

Or use this formula to work out how many working days there are between now and the end of the month.

    =NETWORKDAYS(TODAY(),EOMONTH(TODAY(),0))


You can then use this in your "budget/days" formula.
I'm assuming you mean working days? Here are a couple of approaches:

Holidays are going to be another issue :-)
Thank you so much! The first formula is what I was looking for!
