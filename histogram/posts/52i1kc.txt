Created a customizable U.S. map in Excel, and suggestions for more features?
It's a neat little map, very simple and clean, and looks easy to use.

A feature I can think of that would be nice to have, is if you allow your user to specify the colors. Say, pick the minimum color, and the maximum color.

However, it behooves me to tell you that later versions of Excel already enable you to create heat maps (and more). In Excel 2016, it's called "3D Map."
Super awesome man!
Thanks for the feedback. Exactly on color. Was thinking the same thing. I also need to do something for folks who want to include a lot of zeros for completely blank States.

Also thanks for the new excel version update. Heard about that but every company I've ever worked for is always way behind on excel updates, so hopefully this can help those folks that don't want to get an enterprise version for a simple colored map. Thanks a lot for reviewing!! (Do you know if excel will let you download the map add in in for free on old versions?)
Thank you!
I can't say whether it's free to download or not, since I insist on having the latest shiny new toys :)

However, I will say that your solution has an advantage in that it's more compact. Microsoft actually pulls data from Bing maps, where Alaska and Hawaii in particular are located reaaaaally far away from the mainland.
