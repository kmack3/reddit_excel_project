Is there a quick way of putting 2 $ signs on a specific cell function on multiple cells.
Also, a shortcut to getting the dollar signs on your numbers is F4. 
Are the 12 columns next to each other? if so then make it =(Sheet1!A2*Sheet2!AF$2) and drag across
you want to remove the $ sign or keep it, can you explain a bit more as to exactly what you want to achieve


Thing is the second cell reference changes. 
So there are loads of headers with values that I want to times by some numbers, which relate with the name of the headers. The side numbers go down vertically. 
what to?
can you share screenshot and then explain by giving references?
$AF$3,
$AF$4
etc etc
Well to give a better example




A,B,C,D,E (headers)
125,130,121,111,97 (numbers under)

Then on the side of the same spreadsheet:
A, 12
B, 17
C, 11
D, 9
E, 4

In the (numbers under) I want a formula which times the number in there with the corresponding side number. 
just remove second $ sign, use like this, $AF3 and then drag downwards
So you want 125* times 12, 130 times 17, etc?
still not clear but I assume you want something like this

       =A$2*AA$2

it assumes your headers in first row and values in 2nd row and 2nd data starts from column AA


Not entirely certain but what you are looking for is [this](http://imgur.com/tPDmcuL)?
Downwards as in the side sheet values? When I do that I get an error.
When I drag that it seems to think that the next cell is the column next rather than row next.
Precisely
if you want to increase the row number and keep column constant use "$" sign in front of row like $A2 and vice-versa A$2 for keeping row constant and column increase, I guess in your case the formula will be
      
        =(Sheet1!A$2*Sheet2!$AF2)

or else solution by u/semicolonsemicolon is also correct
If your issue is solved, then please update the post's flair. Thanks.
TYVM. 

SOLUTION VERIFIED!
(Sheet1!A2*Sheet2!$AG$2:$AG$21,2)

Can you tell me what the error is here?
