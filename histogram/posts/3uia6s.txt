How can I create line graphs which dynamically update to show only the data that I am filtering?
Create a pivot table of the data, then a pivot chart on top of that.  The graph will update based on the filter in the pivot
Have the pivot table on a separate sheet. Pivot chart and place slicers on the page to give your users easy control over what to display 
If your version of Excel isn't new enough to have splicer, I know a super cool way to do this with form control check boxes. But if you can use the splicer, that is definitely the best answer
Is there any workaround if position & data of our pivot table is continuously changing?
Thank you for this idea.  I'll play with Pivot tables till  I get it.  

I'm having trouble because my data is in a series  representing gain in elevation.  All other data are to be seen relative to the elevation.  Averages and sums don't matter.  I simply want to plot the data to look like this:

Then, I want to be able to switch between different data sets (altitude data from other locations) and have them automatically update.

Pivot table & slicer is the right answer to this.

Pivot chart is linked to the table not the location, so it shouldn't need a workaround...

But if i move that chart to another sheet and add new data to source then it won't update automatically.
just right click the pivot table and hit refresh
I tried.. but it doesn't work if position and data (column & rows) is changing
I can solve whatever drama you're having, but it's going to be about a 1000 times quicker if it's on skype.
Thanks for your help buddy!
