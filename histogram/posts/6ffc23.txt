How do I color dates based on how far they are from today?
is everything from before today, or is there a combination of before and after.

You could just use conditional formatting --> color scales
In which way it doesn't work? You know you can apply more than one conditional formatting to a cell? This might help you if you want more than a layer of coloring.


Found another resolution. Thanks!
