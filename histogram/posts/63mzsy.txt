Possible to make excel a little more clear about which row im operating on?
Not quite what you're looking for, but pressing Shift+Space Bar will select the entire row of the currently selected cell(s) while keeping the same active cell. That may be enough visual indication for your comparison needs. 
You can use conditional formatting with the formula

    =CELL("row")=ROW(A1)

and in the Worksheet_Change event just put `Calculate`

This can be slow if you have a lot of formulas in your sheet, but I haven't figured out a way to only calculate the conditional formatting without turning on manual calculation.
I'm about to sign off for the night but a possible fix for removing all of your previous cell highlighting is to create a part in the macro that stores the current cell highlighting before overwriting it, and then restores the highlighting as you click away.

Alternatively there may be a way to make the macro make the colors similar to the conditional formatting options where it returns to the previous format once the condition is gone.
TIL shift + space bar.. great tip!

and there's more: ctrl+space for horizontal selection,, shift+ctrl+space for whole sheet selection
