How can i find a RowSource? [VBasic]
Is it a named range? Try Formulas Tab > Name Manager
Yes, i found them there, looks like "=Configuration!$B$2:$B$5"

How can i edit the values?

Go to the Configuration sheet, cells B2:B5. You can edit the values there.

If you don't see "Configuration" along the bottom of Excel with your other sheet names, it's hidden. Right click on any sheet name and click "Unhide" and you'll see a list of hidden sheets. 

[Here](http://www.theofficeexperts.com/VBASamples/Excel02.htm) is a password cracker if you need to unlock a sheet.
Nvm just found that the workbook has that sheet protected by password >.< Looks like i will have to make them from scratch.

Wow, thanks, i'm trying the password cracker, it's taking a while.
It can be slow, lots of combinations to try. Note this won't work with spreadsheet made in the more recent versions of Excel (2013 and 2016 I think)
