Easiest way to compare data between two columns to find the differences?
Conditional formatting - select the "highlight duplicate values" option in the drop-down in the home tab - is probably the easiest way to do this, or at least how I normally do it. You can then filter by color to find the ones that are missing. 
I think you could use EXACT function.  there is another that does is not case sensitive forgot about it. 
I usually make a 3rd column and copy down the formula "A1=B1" (it might be == instead of =). Anyway, this returns FALSE where column A doesn't match column B. Then I filter for all of the falses. 
wow, such an easy workaround and here i was dealing with an annoying formula. thanks!

No problem! It's super handy. If you're not aware, you can also add the "select visible cells" button to the quick access toolbar at the top (or press alt+;), which is handy if you need to paste the list of just unmatching/matching values you've filtered somewhere else.
