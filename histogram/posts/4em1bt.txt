Truth
The worst is trying to figure out spreadsheets built by people whose knowledge of Excel runs out around the point of learning about nested IF functions. 

I've seen some sheets with literally thousands of hidden cells referencing each other because the person who built the file didn't know about Excel's VLOOKUP function.

**Title:** Algorithms

**Title-text:** There was a schism in 2007, when a sect advocating OpenOffice created a fork of Sunday\.xlsx and maintained it independently for several months\. The efforts to reconcile the conflicting schedules led to the reinvention, within the cells of the spreadsheet, of modern version control\.

Amen.


Better yet are similar spreadsheet monstrosities built to do actual complex tasks.  Ones that interface with Access DB's, read websites, and try to pull data from other workbooks whose location was changed three corporate reorganizations ago are all kinds of fun.
Nah, I generally find this one more applicable in most situations: https://xkcd.com/1319/

It would be wonderful if everyone who touches Excel was required to complete 1 hour of training every 6 months.  In my hypothetical world, these bad practices could hopefully be eliminated from new spreadsheets within 3 years, and ideally people would at least start to ask questions about how to do things well in Excel, rather than putting some crappy spreadsheet together utilizing only what they already know.

Knowledge is powerful, but people seem scared to learn.

Or if you are lucky, they weren't changed but you weren't granted access permissions because you were in a different task group, and they don't see why a data analyst should get access to finance's shared drive...
Yeah, I'm currently trying to scrap something that's been built up over 8 years that only causes problems.  I'm putting together an interim solution in excel that will be semi-automated via VBA.  I had originally created something that was very automated, but it scared my superiors so I scaled it back and I'm using some VBA in the background to make it less 'scary'.
Isn't clippy here literally an excel spreadsheet with macros?

Man, if you're not hourly, go home.    

You're giving yourself an effective pay cut by putting in extra time, and are not likely to get compensated to offset it.

Question I'd ask is: "is this model worth saving, or was it a guarantee of employment?"
