No Question just thanks to the Subs!
I'd just like to piggy back on this and express my thanks too.

I'm definitely don't consider myself a power user but with constant reading of this sub I've got a reputation for being a "fixer" for excel related problems at work. 

Cheers guys! üçª
Cool stuff, thanks for sharing!
Yeah, I'm the go to Excel guy in my office as well, and it's largely due the this sub.

I've been working on expanding my Excel-fu and read the top posts in this sub. I try to think about how i would solve the problem, and then I read the comments to see how you all do it! I haven't dabbled too much in Macros other than some copy paste and transpose. That's my next area!
