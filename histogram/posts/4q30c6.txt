[Reminder] Posting Personal Information on reddit and /r/excel
If we see instances of PII being inadvertently posted, do we report the thread? Tag a mod? What is the quickest method of resolving that problem besides telling the user that they shouldn't have done that?
Report first, if you notice the post is still there after 20/30 mins, then tag a mod

We have been fortunate enough to find mods from around the globe to allow for more coverage, so once reported it should not take long for someone to respond, but we are just human (most of us at least!)!
