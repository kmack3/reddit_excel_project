Using variables from called procedures
You could replace all three of them with this function:

    Public Function SearchCol(SearchStr As String) As Long
    Dim c As Long
        For c = 1 To 26 'search cols A-Z
            On Error GoTo Err
            If UCase(Cells(1, c).Value) = UCase(SearchStr) Then
                SearchCol = c 'if match is found then exit the function
                Exit Function
            End If
        Next c
    Err:
    SearchCol = 0
    End Function

You would still need the three variables to hold the column number but you can use it like this:

    FoundColumnQ = SearchCol("Quoted?")
    FoundColumnM = SearchCol("Month")
    FoundColumnAc = SearchCol("Account")
Hi u/one_time_chad (lol),
SOLUTION VERIFIED!

Thanks for this solution that solves the issue and reduces clutter even more

For purposes of learning , if I wanted a solution as per my specs. How would that be implemented? Would you know?
If you called another sub to get a variable, once it hits End anywhere in the subroutine it will clear all the variables it was storing. Generally speaking if you needed a value from somewhere else then you'd call a function as this can pass that value back to where you need it.

You have awarded one point to _one_time_chad_.

Ah , so thats why u gave me that solution.

Makes sense and thanks for the tuition. :)
