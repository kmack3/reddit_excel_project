I'm looking to have a blank World Map on MS Excel so that I can fill in each country I have been to with a colour, and the countries on my list to go to with a different colour. Is this possible? If so, anyone know how?
Here's a link to a file with each country as a shape, I think it should give just what you need: [http://www.clearlyandsimply.com/clearly_and_simply/2009/06/choropleth-maps-with-excel.html](http://www.clearlyandsimply.com/clearly_and_simply/2009/06/choropleth-maps-with-excel.html)
May I ask why you'd like to use Excel for this? I think it would be simpler to just download Inkscape or another vector graphics package and edit [this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/BlankMap-World-Microstates.svg).
Call me crazy, but I think you could do this in something like Paint or a photo editing software better than Excel.

My only thought with Excel would be to somehow screw with your data so that you could use [Power Map](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/get-started-with-power-map-HA104091224.aspx?CTT=5&origin=HA104204034) to highlight certain countries if it has a 1 next to it in the data a certain color and highlight certain countries if it has a 2 next to it in the data, each corresponding with either a country you've been to or want to go to.

Let me know if this works, I'm kinda interested to see how it turns out.

Note: Power Map requires Excel 2013.
As long as you aren't planning to post the map to /r/MapPorn . . . :-P
USE QGIS and you'll be able to do this with a native excel sheet far easier than dinking around in excel.
That's absolutely perfect! Thank you!
That is a nice resource. Thanks.
QGIS even easier
Not at all, I want to print it out to go in my room as a little reminder of why I work - to pay my travel :D

Also, if you're trying to avoid using shapes, this blog post may be helpful.  The author uses lat/long data to create map in cells rather than shapes.  The map may look a bit wonky, but might be easier to update/change/toggle things; a lot of the commenters seem to be proposing fixes to some of the method's shortcomings.  For what it's worth.  Best of luck!

No problem!  I actually had a coworker who drew each border by hand at one point, but that's way too much work for me...
eh, I think going full-blown GIS is overkill. Definitely much more versatile.

Go home Clippy, you're drunk.
How the heck did it even trigger on that?
Interesting... so let me explain why it responded to his 2nd post.

Clippy first checks the comments, since his "first" response was:

> That's absolutely perfect! Thank you!

Clippy said "HEY! TwoFingersInCider needs to mark this as solved."  Once that process started the user made another comment:

> Not at all, I want to print it out to go in my room as a little reminder of why I work - to pay my travel :D

So Clippy being all Clippy like was like wait, now I don't know which comment was the OP's comment that said thanks, so he said "oh well I will just reply to the most recent comment" or the newest comment by the OP... 

hence the crazy post... not sure how to fix that one...
