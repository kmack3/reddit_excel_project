Create a Scrollable Chart for your Excel Dashboards
Nice one. I was struggling with a vertical scrollbar for a while, but got the hang of it.
Good tip. For clarity, isn't there a category for "pro-tips" that reddit threads like this can go in?

As it's slower-moving than "unsolved" the tip will be available to readers for longer.
This is a cool thing to do, thanks for sharing!
