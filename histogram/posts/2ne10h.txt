A new version of Clippy to break...
Great work, /u/fearnotthewrath. He's the only mod that knows the inner workings of Clippy and he deserves all credit for making Clippy what he is. Great work, man!
Love the new clippy, and the general direction.  What would the chances of seeing the source for the bot be?  I would love to look into how the bot works.
Good work!

Clippy doesn't seem to be reminding people to verify solutions. 
Agreed! Good job, /u/fearnotthewrath. Clippy is a big part of what makes this sub so awesome.

Yeah the mods have had this discussion,  while we can assign flair manually, it would be too much for us to manage on a user by user basis.

We could just make the user flair editable, so you can edit your own flair, but then that would eliminate the ClippyPoints, if you could assign your own flair you could put 5000 points...  so you can see how it is a lose lose situation, we either make the ones that want Clippy Points Happy, or we make the ones that custom flair happy...

Not sure what you're refering to. The post only mentioned that the flair will be out for a short period of time. It's not getting removed
Fair comment.  
  
Although... Just thinking out loud...  
  
Clippy could handle it, if he/she? is storing data in a db anyway, then it wouldn't be to tricky to add another field for user defined custom flair - then, when outputting to the page (or to reddit - not sure how it's setup), clippy could output the custom text AND the points score (could even wrap part of it in a html tag so it could be styled differently).  
  
  
Realising that this may still be a bit tricky & need some form of manual action - it could initially be limited to just those users with, say, 9 points or more... :-)  
  
Ultimately, it could be handled by a PM or a mention to Clippy something like :-  
  
Clippy: SET_FLAIR "VLOOKUP is probably the answer"
Well before we turned on ClippyPoints, everyone could set their own flair, and there were some pretty funny ones... my fav:

     #NA #NA #NA #NA Batman

Long story short, we had to turn off custom flair to turn on ClippyPoints. 

/u/BFG_9000 was just saying they missed the custom flair was all... 




Hi!  It looks like you looking for help with an Excel function!  Unfortunately I have not learned that function yet, but will get right on it!


Ahh ok that makes sense. I've not been around long so wasn't here for that. I now want a batman flair :(
> I have not learned that function yet, but will get right on it!

LOL, Thanks Clippy!
