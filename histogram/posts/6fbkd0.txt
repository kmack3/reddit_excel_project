Column Width "Auto Sizing"
At first I thought you were a crazy person, but it turns out that the width goes to the closest multiple of the standard font size...

Thanks for this, it's a TIL for me :)
Ended up helping me turn my assignment in on time! Thank you! I was going crazy over this, excel is a new beast for me.
