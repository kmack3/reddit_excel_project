Thank you, /r/Excel!

Thanks for your kind words.

The mod team has worked hard to ensure that our posts meet a minimum standard, specifically post titles. This helps finding things so much easier, leading to success stories such as this. We're always trying to improve our baseline, but I think we've found a solid one that works.

We've tried to give back to our users through ClippyPoints and recognition (through the sidebar) and I believe we have a really great community who are always ready to help.

Any new suggestions for improvement are always welcome.
One of the best Excel communities that I've personally found.

This is one of the key things this place does well. And it's great to see people learning from the things people post here!
I love this community. I hope to one day give back to this community by responding to others' questions more often. Right now, most on this subreddit know much more than I do, and I'm limited in ability to help. But one day..
This is what I loved the most about being back in school. Stumped on a question? No problem, search for it and you can find an explanation. Excel is really, really, hard to find an explanation. StackOverflow is usually all answers with a strange looking code. Here at /r/Excel I'm finding simple answers, that are easy to understand and watch how they slowly build to be more complex, but the understanding doesn't go away. 

It's awesome.
