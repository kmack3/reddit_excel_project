VBA Help with looping through a horizontal list, checking if a worksheet exists with the same name as the values within those cells in the list and then create a sheet if it doesnt.
Interestingly i solved it myself. Here is the code.

    Sub CreateSheetsFromAList()
        Dim lcol As Long
        Dim sheetToFind As String
        Dim sheet As Worksheet
        Dim MyCell As Range, MyRange As Range
         
         Set MyRange = Sheets("Overview").Range("B1")
        Set MyRange = Range(MyRange, MyRange.End(xlToRight))
    For Each sheet In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        For Each MyCell In MyRange
            If MyCell <> sheet.Name Then
            Sheets.Add After:=Sheets(Sheets.Count) 'creates a new worksheet
            Sheets(Sheets.Count).Name = MyCell.Value ' renames the new worksheet
            End If
        Next MyCell
        Next sheet
    End Sub



Loop through the worksheet names and store them into an array. Then loop through your range and test each value to see if it is in the array. If not, then add it as a new worksheet. 
Imagine you have a sheet named A amongst others. You also have A in you range. How many times are you trying to create A?
