In order to help resolve any confusion on whether or not the Monty Hall problem is a 50/50 or a 1/3 - 2/3, here is an updated version of the "game" with a simulate option added.
One way to think about this problem is to recast the problem like this: suppose you have 100 doors, not 3, and a prize is behind just one door. Would you rather have to select one door (say Door no 17) or have the option to select all the other doors (all the 99 others: nos 1-16; 18-100). Obviously the second choice. 

So say you begin the game with Monty and you say "Door 17". Before he opens it, he opens all the other doors except one. Should you switch? So the choice is your door (17) and the one that is left unopened (say, 43). What are the chances at the beginning of the game that the door you selected is the right one? It's 1/100. What are the chances that door 43 is among the doors that have the prize? It's 99/100. So you should switch. Change the number from 100 back to 3 and it's the same reasoning for switching. 
*Was* there any remaining confusion? It's pretty well documented that it's 2/3 switch - 1/3 stay.
Thanks for sharing this! You rock!
