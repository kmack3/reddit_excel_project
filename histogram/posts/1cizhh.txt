The academic justification for austerity measures in Europe came from a paper and a book by Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart. Now researchers have refuted the study finding that not only was the data tainted by bad statistics, it also had an Excel error
This makes me feel a lot better about my little spreadsheet oversights.
How influential was this paper, actually? It seems like really simplistic reasoning. Testing this with, say, a vector auto-regression would help eliminate some of the reverse causality concerns.
I wrote about this on my Excel blog, which you can read [here](
http://optionexplicitvba.blogspot.com/2013/04/is-excel-to-blame-and-some-updates.html). Most of my friends however admitted it was a tldr; so if you want to skip reading it (and I won't blame you), here are my feelings: I think it's unfair to call this an "Excel error." This is a human error that was done in Excel. Reinhart and Rogoff didn't adequately provide the required rigor to their analysis.

Massively. This time is different is a pretty prominent work and I want to say I've seen it in some major writeps on sovereign debt by the IMF and by a major financial organization.

Lot of the problems arise out of the spottiness of historical data.
I agree with your assessment, sadly it was very influential, and was quoted by a number of scholars when talking about the European debt crisis. http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8973.html
I agree 100% however, the phrase "Excel error" is/was never intended (by me anyway) to denote a flaw in the software, it was simply the mechanisms that were used by the person(s) in error ("Automobile accident", "Plane crash", etc.).

I love your blog btw.
