Excel Test in Upcoming Interview
Piggybacking off what the other poster said, it'll be helpful to know the type of job you're up for. The things you could get tested on might range from pretty basic to relatively advanced.

Here would be my list of things to brush up on (again, not knowing anything about the job):

-freezing/unfreezing cells

-conditional formatting

-vlookups and hlookups (actually typing in the formulas, don't use the wizard)

-index match and index match match; also know the strengths/uses of index and why you might use it over a vlookup and you can show that you know your stuff

-pivot tables - creating and manipulating them; know how to put the fields you want in the right spot (row label, column label, etc) to actually pull back the data you want; know to do a refresh when your data source changes

-if and iferror formulas

-countifs, sumifs and averageifs

-be mindful of some of the helpful tools excel offers also (text to columns with a delimiter, the subtotal tool, remove duplicates tool)

These are the main concepts and formulas I'd suggest, although if there's others you use more frequently in your industry also be mindful of those. These are just the things I use most on a regular or semi-regular basis. You want to show whoever you're meeting with that you're comfortable with all these things, so practice a lot to prep. Make this look like it's all second nature to you.

If you'd like any help with any of the things I listed I'm happy to walk you through them or link a guide.
A lot of the stuff in this article has been mentioned by others already, but this was a great resource for me when I was prepping for Excel interviews:

This site in general is absolutely amazing, so browsing through other articles could be helpful as well. Good luck!
What industry is the company in? What is the role? 

Have a look at the links in the sidebar for some common functions you might be tested on. 

Vlookup or index-match would generally be good to know. 
I would add:

- Slicer

- PowerPivot

- it's good to know at least the basics of VBA, but it would probably be an overkill on the interview;


It is a position with a financial company that develops proprietary financial software built for specific client needs. I would be working in a production testing department for new code with new clients. The job uses SQL for the testing database, but not specifically excel for anything that I am aware of. Ultimately I will be re-learning SQL (used it long ago and have forgotten it).  And thank you for the suggestions!

All good additions, totally forgot about slicers.  

I feel like if OP had to know VBA for this, he/she would probably know it. Still not a bad idea to know some basics though and it could end up impressing the interviewer if it comes up. Even just being able to do a basic record macro wouldn't be bad.
Haha I read your first sentence and thought "oh fuck, op is gonna need some SQL" so good to see you're already getting a leg up on that.

I feel like when I see jobs in this field, they frequently ask for knowledge of Access and/or SAP, but I don't know about the particularities of the job you're gunning for. Those might not be bad skills to pick up down the road. As for the excel stuff, definitely know the things suggested so far and if you have time, I probably would start trying to pick up a little VBA. 

If they didn't mention excel specifically then you might be good and worst case scenario you picked up a little extra knowledge, which is never a bad thing. But if they're hiring you to do database testing with SQL, they might just be assuming that you'd already be proficient in excel (I feel like for a lot of people becoming more advanced in excel is the pathway that then leads to learning VBA and SQL).
