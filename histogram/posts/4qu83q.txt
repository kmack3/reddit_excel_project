How can I select multiple rows without selecting all hidden rows in between those rows?
Highlight the cells you wish to format. Then hit F5, Alt-S-Y. OK. Then set your formatting. The cells in the hidden rows will not acquire the formatting you just set.
There's a Select Visible Cells icon that you need to find in the toolbar menu. It looks like 4 little black squares. I drag mine to the top of my toolbar because I use it so often.

Given your username I assumed you would have used the Alt-; to select visible cells ; )
Awesome. Thank you so much.

Hello!

It looks like you tried to award a ClippyPoint, but you need to reply to a particular user's comment to do so, rather than making a new top-level comment.

Please reply directly to any helpful users and Clippy, our bot, will take it from there. If your intention was not to award a ClippyPoint and simply mark the post as solved, then you may do that by clicking Set Flair. Thank you!

Cool! Today I learned!
You're welcome! Please do solution verified again but in a brand new comment. The bot doesn't pick that up in edited comments.
