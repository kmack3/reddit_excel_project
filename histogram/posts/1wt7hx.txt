Monopoly in Excel [OC]
I did Monopoly in Access a while ago. I would imagine that a lot of the Class Modules and logic would be compatible to Excel if you'd like to collaborate to finish it.
There is actually very little VBA that drives this. Most everything is formula driven. I don't personally have a ton of interest in finishing it since I don't use Excel much anymore. Plus my version of Excel 2010 doesn't like dynamic images (maybe this is fixed in later versions). But you are more than welcome to run with it. Excel is an amazing tool, but I prefer Tableau for analysis these days. 
Who the heck puts a pop-out toolbar over the scrollbar?
Google I suppose. What browser do you use?
Firefox
