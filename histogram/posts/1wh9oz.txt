I made a stock market trading simulation game in excel! I figured you would appreciate it!
Also, it's open source for our VBA aficionados here! :)

Very cool, and thank you for keeping it open source!

Just a quick question after glancing at the code. I thought that declaring variables this way actually declares all but the last variable as a Variant?

"Public Cash, PortfolioValue, PortfolioLongShares, PortfolioShortShares As Double"
I just tried to open it to take a quick look as I don't have much free time today; however it did give me some errors saying something about not working on Windows 7 x64

'Compile Error: The code in this project must be updated for use on 64-bit systems. Please review and update Declare statements and then mark them with the PtrSafe attribute.'
I think the one that you are alluding to is how the game ends for everyone :)
I didn't think that was true... however I just tested it with a:

    MsgBox (VBA.VarType(Cash))

Before the variable is initialized and received a VarType of 0. I then ran it again after being initialized and received a VarType of 2. Thanks for pointing this out! I now need to check all of my excel projects to make sure I didn't make the same mistake!
Thanks for the error report. I've changed the declarations in a new version. Please redownload let me know if it works for you.

Old:

    Declare Sub Sleep Lib "kernel32" (ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long)

New:

    #If VBA7 And Win64 Then
        Declare PtrSafe Sub Sleep Lib "kernel32" (ByVal dwMilliseconds As LongLong)
    #Else
        Declare Sub Sleep Lib "kernel32" (ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long)
    #End If
Just use a 32 bit install. It probably uses a 32 bit library, which won't work on a 64bit install. Very few people use 64 bit, so it seems fair to pander to the majority
Thanks, it works now... although i have *no* idea what i am doing :o)
Almost everybody uses 64bit systems these days because almost everything is compiled for windows and windows 32bit is limited to 4gb of physical memory.
Push buttons and pray to the random number generator gods! :)
They definitely don't. I don't have a single client using 64 bit. It causes too many compatibility issues when using additional libraries in VBA
