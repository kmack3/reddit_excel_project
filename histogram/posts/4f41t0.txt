[Discussion] I have the opportunity to upgrade Office and I'm not sure what is best and right.

2010 if you use regularly use multiple instances of Excel.

2013 if you don't regularly use multiple instances of Excel, or you don't know what that means.
If someone else is paying, buy a perpetual license. They're still available, even for Office 2013.

As for cost, you can't legally use noncommercial Office 365 Home or Personal because what you describe is obviously commercial use. Tell your former boss that you'd need to buy Office 2013 Professional. There's an outside chance they have a volume purchasing deal which allows employees and maybe contractors to buy Office Pro cheap. Even if not, Office 2013 Pro isn't that expensive.
>> Everything seems to have an annual fee which I can't afford.

But isn't your company paying for it?
Get 2016 or 365.

If you've been doing your job on 2003 so far, it probably doesn't matter if you get 13 or 16, but i don't see a reason why you'd get something less.

I don't think you should worry about cost too much, not because you're taking advantage of your friend, but because when he hires you again next year and his organization is on 365, he'll need to pay for you again if you decide to get 2010 or 2013.

You definitely shouldn't go lower than 2013 as you won't be able to leverage data models etc. Which he would benefit from you using.

Even if you aren't going to be using any of the features, then don't think that he will think you're a better man for buying an old version of the product he specifically told you to buy a new version of, because you're saving him a couple of dollars..
Any recommendations on working with 2016 and sending it back to a 2013 environment?  I really don't want to abuse this because we've had a 15 year working relationship.

Thanks for letting me know.  I figured the MS site was steering me wrong.

What the handicap with 2013?  I do multiple windows all the time but I have had to run multiple versions of Excel a few times during development.

Since the dude offering to buy it uses 2013, it seems shitty to not be at that level.
I found 2013 for $220 and just wrote him confirming that he was ok with it.  For what the contract is for I'll need Access (sorry folks but it can do some stuff better) so the price is higher.

Thank you everyone for the input.
Just for the upgrade.  I'm only on a 4 to 6 week contract.
If the former workplace/boss uses 2013, you should get 2013.  You will avoid ugly gotchas that could catch you out.

w/ 2013 can be difficult to track which windows are assigned to which instances.
Does your company have Microsoft Home Use Program? http://www.microsofthup.com/
