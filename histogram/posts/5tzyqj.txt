Do you use excel to organise your home life?
[Here](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/) is a list of possible spreadsheets...but I'm not sure 90% of them are worth tracking in my own daily life...It's more of a necessity thing - what do you actually want to keep track of and make the effort to do so? 

Also, [this](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTemplates/meal-planner.html) is something you might find helpful in terms of designing layout and functionality. 
I use Excel for a bunch of silly stuff. Since I am the only consumer and I don't care about pretty, none of them are. A few are color coded for inputs and calculated fields.:  

* A "bills" spreadsheet where all my fixed payments for the year are entered with payment schedule (weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, etc) for planning payroll funds to allocate to a specific "bills" account.  
* A ["Paycheck" spreadsheet](http://i.imgur.com/JrJT9Ja.png) where I can plan allocation of my complete paycheck with different numbers "locally" - I.e. " what if I kick my retirement contribution up to X Roth and y traditional, then allocate $z to my liquid savings... What does my "allowance" look like then?  
* Ghetto retirement estimator - given some assumptions when might I be able to retire? What if the market performs better than expected? What if inflation is higher? What if I up my contributions?  
* Retirement rebalancer - beginning of the year, and I've got 5.5k more to put into my IRA, let's set the asset allocation back to my desired ratios.   
* Annual Spend - I don't actually track all my spending, but I have historical "net worth" numbers from mint, and old tax returns. So this is a "based on gross income, retirement contributions, taxes, and liquid net worth, how much money did I spend each year the past 8 years?" 2014 to 2015 my income went up 9k and my spending only went up 4k. Between. 2015 and 2016, gross went up 6k, spending went up 5k.
* ["Shit I own"](http://i.imgur.com/TlfBboG.png) - not fancy at all, but a list of things I own with serial numbers, values, purchase history.  If I go camping and someone steals all my camping gear, I've got recorded most of the stuff which disappeared for insurance reporting purposes. Likewise for my bike/apartment. This one is mostly just a list with no lookups/formulas.  
* Probably 3 or 4 spreadsheets related to games I play. And not really "spreadsheet" games like Eve either. Boom Beach, DnD.  
* [Bulk Lunches](http://i.imgur.com/wNT6ak9.png) - Like you, I've got at least one food oriented one. When I get I to bulk cooking of souls, stews, chili, burritos, etc, I'll generally log the ingredients and costs into a spreadsheet, as well as the eventual number of servings for a laborless "cost per meal." Curried chicken chowder $2.51 per serving, burrito batch 1 $1.97 per serving, burrito batch 2 $1.43 per serving, etc.
* Plus a bunch of sheets sitting around from trying to answer questions here. 
This thread makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside - you folks are definitely my people!  
&nbsp;  
I have been using a spreadsheet to track my monthly budgets and savings for almost 3 years, so I have a lot of data. I like to make tables and graphs summarizing it.   
&nbsp;  
I've recently started a meal planning/grocery list workbook.  
&nbsp;  
I like the "stuff I own"/assets idea thrown around in here, I may start that. 
My wife and I use excel for budgeting. 

But I use google sheets to track how many cups of coffee, tea, or water I drink correlated to how many times I go to the bathroom.
I made a spreadsheet that builds a 12 week, full body, workout program.  It basically is a collection of exercises that is broken down by push-pull motions and basic movements i.e. vertical, horizontal, knee dominant, etc.  I used excel functions to build a list, choose random workouts from that list, and choose the # of repetitions/sets based on the type of program I picked using a data validation: hypertrophy, strength, and endurance.

EDIT: 02/15/17 added imgur link for requested sample pics.  The screen caps were taking from my phone.

No, because too slow, but I read an article on medium some time ago to make a personally adapted tracking sheet that looked very well done. Actually I should do mine somehow (even if not in excel).

Yes, I use it at home for a variety of things. For one thing I do crock pot freezer meals for most of our weekday meals. I started out with a spread sheet I created from selecting recipes from a blog I found with an extensive list of recipes. I have a spread sheet of bills, income, and appointments and I have an extensive bucket list of places I'd like to see and things I would like to try.  I have it set up so that there is a page that sorts by location and another that sorts by activity types. Great for when I find a good travel deal and need to come up with somewhere I want to use it to visit on the fly. Once I've booked hotel and airfare I start a new spread sheet for that trip. One page for ideas of what to do with pricing and available times and then a page with detailed itinerary. I think there are apps for this stuff now, but I've been doing it this way since before smartphones were a thing so I am just used to it I suppose. I've tried a couple of the smartphone apps but they just don't seem to flow as nicely for me somehow. All in what one is used to I'm sure.
I only do that for Finances such as portfolio tracker and budget.
Absolutely! How else could I arrange my bills/expenses so they are within $0.01 on the first and fifteenth of every month?
I do not.  But, I do use Omnifocus 2.  It is absolutely amazing and integrates with everything I need it to.  Hands down the #1 reason why it's so great for me is that I can think of something while I'm driving and say, "Hey Siri.  Remind me to buy stamps."  When I get back to my computer, it's in the Inbox of Omnifocus.
I use excel for budget tracking of my daily expenses as well as monthly expenses. I pretty much account for every penny incoming or outgoing. I have to live pretty tightly and this really helps as I track daily. 

I use it for work and so I'm learning a lot about excel still. There's so much I don't know and yet so many fun possibilities!
Over the course of my life I have used excel for damn near everything from budget to video game progress to making video games to...everything.
I have a massive Google Sheets workbook with my food diary, budget, debt planner, family tech support information, my catalog of software/digital goods (Unused steam keys etc), and my freelance work log and invoices.

A few of those sheets I no longer use (I used YNAB for budgeting now, and Cron-o-meter for food tracking), but I love my workbook :)
I'm an accountant.  When I was first learning double-entry bookkeeping, I decided to keep double-entry books for myself for a month as a chance to practice.  That was January 2011 and I am still doing it, penny-perfect, every month.
I have a general one i use for outlining my budget, but not for daily tracking. Making sure bills are paid and what not.
I made a check list of things to do before a trip: get a dog sitter, stop the mail, ... All the tedious stuff that's easy to forget.   And I use Google Sheets so I can share our the tasks
I have a financial tracker spreadsheet of assets and liabilities that I've projected out past retirement. I reconcile once a month and compare between each individual item of actual and projected. Also, have an overall balance comparison. I also use it to view my ROI on investments. I have an investment account that doesn't add reinvested dividends into the cost basis and others that do. It's nice have an apples to apples comparison.
Use it for the joint account to track all bills. And "flexible" spendings (groceries, gas and "other"). 
I actually use OneNote more for organizing, because I can link it to my tablet and my business workbooks. Since it's also Microsoft it's compatible with Excel so anything that really requires a filterable spreadsheet can be linked to a workbook page. There are some decent tutorial videos to get ideas of what to use it for on the Microsoft site.

I love OneNote -- don't know why I took so long to start using it.
Building budgets and tracking finances. Tracking weight.
I've got a steadsheet simply called "Budget" that has a couple sheets

On one sheet I have my income and expenses listed out for an average week, along with how much debt I currently have. I then copy that budget 12 times laterally and Delete things from the column as I've paid for them, while putting in any overspending.

I also have a sheet that has my workout plan, a sheet my diet for the rest of the year, a sheet with a list of food products and their prices, and a sheet that helps me keep track of each of the 1099 gigs I'm doing.

It's good to be organized.
I have a Asset List - Anything worth more then $500 or has a long term use and warranty. I record where, and when i bought it from, how much, the warranty, serial number, andy notes.

I have a sheet for churning (opening and closing creditcards/bank accounts primarily for signon bonuses) - There are lots of dates related to keeping track of which cards to open and what fees and when to cancel and when I could reapply for them....checkout r/churning if you are interested.
I do too! Thank god I'm not the only Excel nerd x) I use it for meals, budgetting, basically every video game I play, and to estimate my GPA by inputting my grades in (uni life got me like).
I use Excel anytime I can for personal things.  I combine that with MS One Note when I really want to geek out.
I use a meal planner like you are talking about. It is pretty cool for me. What we do is have the meals in one column, and the date last prepared in the next and the dates have conditional formatting. Instead of trying to decide what I should cook I just look at the list and it tells me what i haven't had in awhile. It has definitely added a lot more variety to our meals and it looks like a menu which is pretty neat. 
I have a series of spreadsheets I have been  using to project the cash flow in/out of my bank account for the past 4 years or so.

I also have workbooks for a variety of things, like scenario analysis around the tax implications of different 401k contribution rates (based off of an online calculator) and loan amortization tables.

As if I didn't play in spreadsheets enough at work already....
I'm a contractor so I use it to keep track of how much tax I need to set aside from paychecks but I really need to create some annual statements for myself. 
I used it for our wedding planning! :) (Copy/pasted from where I shared this info previously.)

The first tab is guests (arranged numerically by card number - described below):

* Last Name

* First Name

* Street Address

* City, State, ZIP

* RSVP Card number (I lightly numbered each RSVP on the back in case it came back without a name)

* RSVP response

    -If yes, 1 (that is, type the number 1 under this header if their RSVP is yes)

    -If no, 1 (that is, type the number 1 under this header if their RSVP is no)

* Gift (used as reminder for when writing thank you cards)

* Thank you written (yes/no)

* Thank you sent (yes/no)

We also used the good/bad/neutral formatting on Excel as our guess for RSVP response and edited it as they started coming in; good - yes; bad - no; neutral - not sure. The "if yes/if no" also has a running sum at the bottom of each column so we knew how many people are attending.

Tab 2 has a summary of our venues (name, address, # of guests allowed, costs, etc.)

Tab 3 is similar to 2, but is for rentals (tent, tables, and chairs) and a cost comparison.

I don't recall what all is on the other tabs (it's on my home computer), but we also have information about seating arrangements, lists of favors, and other things we've done for the wedding and associated costs.

Edit: I also had an Excel sheet dedicated to our costs.

It had category, vendor, description, price, and associated notes, and looked something like this (this version is much more simplified):

**Category** | **Price** | **Notes**
---------|----------|----------
Venue | $1,650.00 | Included $300 deposit (also included various sized tables and 50 chairs)
Catering | $2,006.25 | 2 main dishes, 3 sides, 4 drinks; included staff, plates/silverware/cups, tablecloths, and napkins
Cake | $406.00 | Included delivery and set up
Decor | $275.44 | Tea lights, mason jars, memento table, memory table, picture frames, etc.
Stationary | $422.00 | Invitations, RSVP cards, thank you notes, etc.
Favors | $375.16 | Coffee and votive tea lights
Attire/Rings | $665.00 | [Dress](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/ever-adulatory-lace-dress) and shoes from ModCloth; suit from Macy's; rings from Walmart & Gemvara
Musician | $600.00 | Included $50 tip; 5 hours of performing (before/during ceremony & reception)
Rentals | $1,132.18 | 9 tables, 30 chairs, 30'x30' tent & set up
Marriage License | $30.00 | Self-explanatory
Flowers | $85.92 | Both from Eco Flower
Hair | $75.00 | Included $15 tip
Miscellaneous | $55.49 | Pumpkins and flowers for front of house; cake topper; programs
**Grand Total** | $7,778.44
I use it to keep track of money spending (obvious) but also to do weekly meal planning. I have it set up so I can put in what I want to make, then what I have and don't have for ingredients so it puts together my shopping list.

I've also used it to track stats in sports management games (FIFA, Football Manager). I wouldn't consider that "home life" but I set it up nicely and it is fun to use.
I have a excel sheet which is basically used as a dictionary object. I use it for keeping track of who I contact for each of my needs. For instance...

Electricity: ABC Energy

Housing: XYZ Properties

Health Insurance: ASDF Healthcare

and so on...
I use Excel to track my running records. It stores date, distance, duration, last meal before running, etc. It also calculates speed, avarages and totals per month.
I have tracked all of my work hours, work invoices, personal income, expenses, bill paying, bank account balancing, credit card accounts, retirement savings, amortized all my loans, tracked monthly budgets, and keep track of xmas gift giving and other misc stuff for about 10 years.  I'm on about my 12th version of a beast of a spreadsheet that currently goes back to 2014.  I would be completely lost without my baby.

I also use excel for engineering calculations, gambling wins/losses and simulations, beer brewing calculations and recipes, tracking cigars and their ratings and costs and anything else I can use it for.

During various fitness efforts over the years I have tracked weight, body fat, calories, etc.  At one time I had a pretty cool chart of daily weight, body fat, and blood pressure for about 3 years with a few small breaks in between.  Watching those peaks and valleys was pretty interesting and sometimes motivating.
I am currently just starting to use excel to grocery shop. I compare non sale prices from a few budget grocery stores. And will use the info to shop better in the future
I once made a kind of morbid spreadsheet with a small cell representing everyday of my life with significant events color coded in on the correct days or periods of time (jobs, marriage, birthdays, moves, deaths, etc).  I made it where I could zoom out and see 100 years worth of days with events noted in a single view.  It was kind of neat to see a record of my whole life in one image.  I hope I make it to the end.
I started a gambling one recently. How much money I took in and how much I walked out with. I have one for my wage, raises and promotions over time. Budgeting one, and one looking at how paying different amounts into debt will effect the pay off period and interest saved
I have a reading log and book list. The reading log is just how long and how many pages I read. I was curious if there are any patterns to my reading habits or not. And the book list is so I can keep track of all the books I read this year and see if I meet my goal.
I use Google Sheets in personal life, Excel at work. Personal use: tracking recurring bills, shopping lists, movie lists, my paycheck and vacation accruals.
I have one to track gas mileage for my car. I write on the receipt the mileage from the odometer and the reset it. On the spreadsheet I enter the date, miles driven, price and total paid and it does the rest. I have graphs showing actual vs average vs moving average for both mpg and per gallon price paid. Because I always fill my take completely and the owners manual will tell you the capacity of your gas tank, I have the sheet tell me how much gas was left in the tank and at the mpg for that fill up, how much farther could I have driven.  I have conditional formatting that show a graduated color spectrum from green (good) to red (bad) for where mpg and $ per gallon paid fits in the overall list of data points.
Since I have the workbook saved to OneDrive, I can edit the sheet from my phone, tablet, home computer, or work computer. 
I have over 8 years of data in that sheet now and it's neat to see the fluctuations in gas prices over the years. Sub $1 to almost $4.  I'm in the Denver Colorado metro area. I had a similar workbook going prior to my current one that had another 8 or so years on it but I lost that sheet when my old laptop died and I had no back up 😖.
I have a couple sheets just for games plus workbooks for fitness, calorie intake, and recipes with prices. I'm a student and use excel frequently for engineering calculations and daily at my work.

Some snapshots of my gaming sheets. They're not pretty but they get the job done :) http://imgur.com/a/1q4Lj
I buy everything on one electronic card from one account.

I go online, download the CSV from my bank and append it to a finance sheet.

I then go into the sheet and categorize the purchases under common headers.

Like this.

Transaction Date|Transaction Type|Transaction Description|Debit Amount|Credit Amount|Balance|*Source*|*Category*|*Type*|*Varience*|*State*|*Tax Year*|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
2/1/2015|CASHPOINT|LNK ASDA GRIMSBY 1|20|	|3832.58|ASDA|Shop|Cash|-20|Ougoing|2014
2/1/2015|DEBIT_CARD|TESCO STORES 5159|5.3|	|3821.98|Tesco|Shop|Purchase|-5.3|Ougoing|2014


I have a lookup table that links the Transaction descriptions into certain types of category and source.

Every time a new shop is added I add it to the look up.

So at the end of the year, I can do this.
#[Pivot the data](http://imgur.com/7NolV1q)

I can assess where my overspending is for the year and drill down into it.

I can also do my taxes pretty easily because it is all based on the same details.

I always buy my fuel from the same place so it makes my fuel calculations really easy and I always fill my car up with 20 litres, so I can see the cost fluctuations on my charts, so I can plan based on trends.

And because I update it monthly, I can get a weekly overview and check my money bleed before it becomes serious.

I was hemorrhaging money last year and the year before, now I am in the black. 

Keep your eye on your money, or it can easily be pissed away.
I've over engineered diy excel sheets for every single personal use you can imagine and more. I also co-engineered a sheet with my ex that looked up a list of meals we like, weighted by health l, convenience, and cost, and randomly generated a meal plan for the week, just so we didn't have to think for ourselves. 

I'm bragging but if you want inspiration for the most complicated way to plan anything in excel, just ask me.
That layout is great, but the main function I want is an automatic grocery list. That resource list it's pretty comprehensive, I'm sure I'll be using one of them in the future!
Good stuff. I'm going to steal your "shit I own" idea!
Not gonna lie, I lost it at the typo of "cooking of souls."
Reading your post is making me realize I really need to start thinking about long-term financial planning... the personal inventory sheet is also a great idea.

I also use spreadsheets for gaming! I created a spreadsheet for our weekly Kingdom Death: Monster game since there is SO much bookkeeping for the settlement, resources, characters, etc. I'm pretty proud of it, but I still have a lot of things I want to add to it. How do you use excel for DnD? My group mostly uses OneNote for organization purposes.
Stuff I own is a great idea.  I always wanted to take a call phone video the main belongings inside of my house, top to bottom, place it on an SD card, and save it in case of a house fire/burglary.  Would the insurance company accept this?
Let's see that pee plot!
I used Excel for budgeting before switching to YNAB. But I still use it to plan my savings and what goes where.
Why don't you create an IFTTT button to add it to the spreadsheet for you. 

You just need 3 buttons. 
Can I see what your sheet looks like?
[deleted]
Would you mind sharing the crockpot one? That's exactly what I've been doing. We don't have time to cook in the evening but I've got time in the morning so the crockpot has been our life. 
Ooo I'd like to see this if you wouldn't mind sharing! 
My girlfriend still doesn't understand how stress I get when my bank account doesn't reconcile  ...
I read that this afternoon.  I thought about correcting, but decided to leave it!

No clue.  Probably. The one guy I know who actually made an insurance claim due to burglary didn't have to jump through many hoops. The adjuster mostly asked for a list of items taken and replacement cost.  

This was back when he was fresh out of college and all that was taken was a TV and various video game systems and games.  

I started my list because he didn't have a list anywhere of what games he had, so he had to guess "about 30 Xbox games" and estimate a value per game. This worked fine for his adjuster.  

I will log major housewares/furniture purchases which might be destroyed in a fire or building collapse,  or things I am likely to get stolen or lost. Like my cell phone and other mobile devices/accessories, biking gear, camping gear.
That's actually what I do. I have 4, one for water, coffee, tea, and for the bathroom. It adds a line with a split formula wrapped in an eomonth to get just the month. Then I have a pivot and some graphs that roll the data up to show it by month.

I don't really know how to share a spread sheet online but as soon as I figure it out I would be happy to. All I did was go to [this website](http://www.mommysfabulousfinds.com/2013/05/5-easy-crock-pot-recipes.html) and look at each recipe. If I liked it, I added everything for it on a spread sheet set up four columns. One each for number, of what measure, of what item, for which recipe. So if a recipe needed 1 cup no sugar added applesauce for Apple BBQ Pork Chops I would put 1 | cup | no sugar added applesauce | apple bbq pork chops where the | signifies the columns. That way I was able to sort by column 3, copy to a new page, and add each item together on that page for the shopping list. I could resort by recipe and print out to have the recipes for the items I'd purchased. If we didn't like a recipe,or wanted to add a new one, that was pretty easy.
