Some great innovative projects, with templates, code and videos for those fed up with just tables of numbers..yawn.  A great way to learn and Trevor's a really nice guy who'll help you out and has always responded to my emails quickly.  http://www.onlinepclearning.com/  Youtube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/OnLinePCLearning/videos
When AC/DC released the [Worldâ€™s First Music Video in Excel ACDC Rock n Roll Train](http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/11/03/excel-links-acdc-rock-roll-train-video/), that rocked!  Here's a [Rolling STone](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ac-dc-turn-rock-n-roll-train-into-worlds-first-excel-video-20081031) blurb on it, and [vere's a video of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vs2XUffK-1w).
The links don't work to the music server any more, but if you want to dig into the VBA behind it, this link www.poengyar.com/files/other/acdc.xls will download the spreadsheet.
I built a roster for a call centre that broke the day down into 15 minute blocks. Showed demand vs staff available to take calls and numbers of people on break at any one time in a graph and calculated wages based on a complex award. Also calculated predicrlted service level for the day .I had help from online forums with a bit of vba code. I used this for rostering the call centre and forecasting cost for whole time i was in the job.  
Very good. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Doesn't answer the question at all...
Yeah got out of that.
Your answer sounded like a stock interview answer for some reason.
