Disconnecting my mouse today, any tips?
Flair changed to discussion.

Press the Alt key and enjoy looking at the tooltips that popup at the top.

If your used the basic shortcuts i.e. ctrl+tab, alt+tab, ctrl+pageup/down then you'll be fine to be fair...
I don't think it's common knowledge but there's a key to the right of the space bar on most keyboards that opens the right click menu. Opening it this way will also underline the key that shortcuts to each item in the list
I basically fly w/o a mouse for most of my excel sessions (its there just hardly touched)

My Most used:

* Ctrl-Space / Shift-Space : Select Entire Column, Select Entire Row
* Alt+i+e : Insert, when used with above inserts columns/rows
* Alt + = : AutoSum
* Ctrl + Arrow Key (Shift optional): Hop (Select) to next cell which has a value, or Last contiguous cell with a value.
* Alt + e + s + V/F/T/R/U : Paste Special, Values/Formulas/Formats/FomulasNumFormats/ValuesNumFormats
* Ctrl + PgUp/PgDn - Cycle Between Worksheets

whoah.  

this thread is implying we can go faster without a mouse?  In Excel?  

how the heck does anyone do that?...   I know a few keyboard cuts, but dang.... it gets ridiculous sometimes.


I made a 45 minute instructional video that goes through all the shortcuts that I think are most important, in a way that can help you find and remember the ones that are useful for you, long term:

Happy to elaborate / clarify any of it.
Here's a list of essential shortcuts http://chandoo.org/wp/2010/02/22/complete-list-of-excel-shortcuts/

And a fun game to test your knowledge

I first started using spreadsheets in the late 80s.  I didn't have a mouse at all.  When I transitioned to Excel somewhere in the late 90s, I was forced (at least I thought) to start using a mouse.  I hated it.  

At this point, I'm not sure if I want to start learning all the shortcuts.

(Not that this helps your question in any way.)
make use of your quick access toolbar. Here is a tutorial:

- People often forget about scroll lock because the key is never ever used and is even missing on some laptop keyboards. If it is enabled, cursor keys do not select cells, but scroll the current view. Hold CTRL while using the cursor keys to scroll a whole screen page at once. This can get useful if you edit a cell but want to scroll your view to somewhere else, without leaving the edit mode.
- When editing, you can not only hop into the formula editor with F2 so the cursor keys work like they do in word, but you can also hop out of it using F2 again.

**EDIT:** If you plan on physically disconnecting the mouse, [buy this instead for cheap](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Manual-Two-Way-USB-Data-Transfer-Switch-/221704126135), then connect the mouse to the I/O port and your computer to A port. Then label A as "ON" and B as "OFF". Much more comfortable than physically disconnecting the mouse. At the same time it also makes your USB cable longer. Does not needs power. If you connect a USB hub to it, you can turn multiple devices on and off.
Once you get comfortable, put a towel over your hands/keyboard and try everything you've been doing without being able to look.  It sounds easy if you're already comfortable typing without looking but it'll still get tricky.
Alt+pgup and pgdn switches your current tab. Edit: CTRL* thanks for the correction. I am on mobile and need the muscle memory on a physical keyboard apparently :-)
Hit alt, take a screenshot and print it out?
How do you replicate holding the right mouse button and dragging cells - the 'shift down and move' option gets a lot of use for me
This is key (get it...).

Also the navigation keys (arrow keys, page up/down, home, end, tab and enter) and the navigation keys in combination with the modifier keys (Ctrl, shift and alt).

If there are particular things you want to do and you know of a button for it, plug the mouse in and give the pointer over then button for a few seconds. Some information may appear, and that into may include a shortcut.
shift + F10 too...
Agreed with the above, but 
Shift - Space selects an entire row for me. 

Alt + O + H + R -- Rename Tab
Alt + H + L + H + E -- Conditional Format cells equal to a value (great when checking long lists for true/false if you don't want to sort, or when the comparison cells are subject to change)


Most people I know who work in finance and 100 hour/week consulting jobs, are actually forced to start their jobs without mice. It forces them to learn all the shortcuts. But I'm with you, I can't imagine it.
I still have a lot to learn about excel, but I almost never use the mouse.
The learning curve is high, but the rewards are insane. 

It's not just Excel, but almost everything in a computer except graphic design, and in that case there's better than a mouse. Mice are a crutch we're taught to use and which the programmers have adapted to people using, and when you learn to stand without them you'll feel insanely good. 
This is what a usb device would look like in fallout.
Or switch to a wireless mouse. It has an "off" switch. Very easy.
In Excel 2013 this just makes the sheet scroll left and right. Ctrl-PgUp/PgDown has always worked for me though for changing tabs.
The cell you want to copy click ctrl + c, then highlight the cells you want to "drag down or across to using ctrl + left/right/down, then alt -> h -> v -> f to paste formulas, it's the same as dragging down or across
You are correct!, Its Shift Space, not alt+space
alright... I'll bite then:

are there good tutorials to not using a mouse, or good places to start?  I bet I can conjur up a list of keyboard shortcuts easy enough, but ya'll imply there's more than a list of 20 shortcuts.

Thoughts?

In fallout you would then find a skeleton, bent over a computer, desperately trying to insert a USB plug, but he could not manage to do so in time because you never ever plug those bloody things in right on the first try. So sad, because that doomsday prevention device would have been useful
but requires batteries. Also I have seen people complaining that the wireless mouse causes delay when insane reaction is required in a game
Not drag down, but moving data. Swap the positions of columns C and D for example

I would highlight column C, drag it over with a right click and then click shift right and move
Instead of forcing yourself to remember a ton of arcane shortcuts, just start not using the mouse.  Any time you want to use your mouse to click something on the ribbon, look up and use the hotkey, even if it's slower at first.  With this method, you'll quickly learn the hotkeys that are most useful for the things that you need to do with excel.

Regardless of what you're doing in excel though, I'd say the basic movement shortcuts (i.e. ctrl+arrow, shift+arrow, ctrl+shift+arrow, ctrl+pgup/down) are very useful.
I'm not sure if there are any good tutorials, my first experience with it was in like 1998 when my mouse broke and I was forced to use my computer for a few days without it since driving to the city to get a new mouse was not a priority for my parents.

I'd start by reading the shortcuts summary in the Help menu of whatever programs you use regularly, and experimenting with different combinations of the Control, Tab, Shift, Alt, Space and Arrow keys to see what they do in what programs. Most of the functions are pretty standard, like Tab will almost always switch focus to the next thing, and Shift+Tab will shift focus the other direction.

A lot of the hotkeys are specific to particular programs, although they often make a lot of sense, and sometimes specific versions of that program. If you use Microsoft Office 2013 or 365, try just pressing Alt on its own and a bunch of hotkeys will be highlighted and hover over what they do (for example, pressing Alt, a, s, s will open the menu to sort a selection in Excel 2013)

Oftentimes when you open a new menu, you'll notice that certain letters are underlined in the options, normally pressing that key will execute that command.

It's an adventure I've undertaken without much instruction, but I'm sure a *good* computer use class would teach this kind of stuff. Most computer use classes are not good, sadly, but YouTube is huge so there might be people there. 
::nod::

I'm fairly good with the basics, and I regularly have to teach folks about ctrl-tabs and alt-tabs, which blew my mind when I learne dabout them... but I wouldn't htink I know enough to unplug the mouse. 

 I've already printed up excel cheat sheets and posted them on the wall for reference... we'll see how this comes along.

I recommend actually unplugging your mouse for a couple hours after you think you know your way around a bit, it'll force you to run head on into whatever you've still been using the mouse for.
