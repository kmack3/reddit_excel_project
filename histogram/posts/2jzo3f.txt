/r/Excel is trending! Welcome new subscribers!
I want to thank everybody who upvoted and commented on my post. I never expected it to go viral and I have never thought it would be possible for me to make the front page with a post in /r/excel.  It has caused [quite an increase in subscribers](http://redditmetrics.com/r/excel) and was my most successful post ever made.

I also want to point out, that I have not much knowledge about excel itself, I just applied my regular programming skills on VBA.

The real heroes are the people who actually know how all the formulas work and answer all the questions here, and I hope my submission did not delayed the support for those who had real questions.

I have published the excel workbook (and a secondary one for internet browsing in excel) [on Github](https://github.com/AyrA/ExcelStuff). Feel free to use them for whatever you want. I will probably expand this repository over time with new additions and updates to existing stuff if issues are opened or pull requests are made.

Thank you everybody!

if you wish I can create further posts if I ever come up with another crazy problem solver.
You guys even have an automated clippy assistant??

*subscribed*
Where have you guys been all my life?
Pretty sure it's trending because of the post about making a media player in Excel and the post on /r/bestof

Thank you for the warm welcome.... but I dropped in hoping I'd find a similar subreddit in the sidebar for Powerpoint.

Can somebody point me in the right direction?
Do you guys have an Excel Basics type of page for people interested in learning excel?
I found /r/excel because of that media player post as well, but recently for database position at college I have been transposing and transforming data in excel which led me to start using VBA. I like what it has it offer and figured subscribing to /r/excel would help me down that path. Thanks everyone! Here's to future questions! 
Is there an /r/excel for complete noobs? 
Thanks for the warm welcome. I'll hope to learn and contribute once I fix my laptop.
So, do you just have to mention clippy for the bot to pick it up?
Its trending bc some dude figured out how to look productive at work while actually watching movies in excel.  Its why I subbed (and to step my skills up).
hey folks.  I am creating a spreadsheet for "necessary inventory".
Let's say I have four widgets.  For every four widgets, I need 1 wocket.
Sometimes, there will only be 1 widget, but I still need a wocket.
If I have 8 widgets, I need two wockets.  Get it?

What kind of formula should I use to ensure I always have at least 1 wocket, but increments 1 for every four widgets I add?

thanks!
Hi! I should have looked for this sub a long time ago. I noticed it trending so I popped in and subbed. Nice place you have here.
Happy to be here - after the company excel wizz was laid off because of personal issues, the spot is vacant. Hoping to learn alot from you guys!
We're going to be busier, awesome! :)
Hi!  It looks like you are a fan of me!  Here have a Clippy point!

+1 Point


I was blown away when I first joined, too. /u/AutoModerator wasn't cutting it for us, so /u/fearnotthewrath decided to build one himself and he did a fantastic job with it.

Welcome to the sub!
same here.
We've been right here, waiting for you to find us!

Welcome to the sub!
Thats how I found it. No regrets.
We are aware, hence the thanks in the OP.
... yes, credit to the post author is right there in the first sentence of the post
Not me, nope, no way...I've been here the whole time.

We call that magic pivot tables.
Arise, chicken.

Chicken, arise.
/r/powerpoint 

That said, /r/excel is definitely the most active of the MS Office subreddits. 
As /u/iamramy said, /r/powerpoint is the place for all PowerPoint related questions. There's a little icon at the top of the menu bar (if you use our subreddit style) that takes you to the other MS Office subreddits as well as to /r/Windows.

Welcome to the subreddit!
You can check out our Wiki [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/wiki/index) There, you'll find all of the basics, including some frequently used formulas (which I still need to finish, but what I have is up there.) Also, be sure to check out the advice thread repository.

If you have specific questions, submit a new post and let us help you out!

Mind if I ask what kind of database you plan on building and what software you're using besides Excel? If you're not using anything else besides Excel, you might want to look into something else because, as much as I love Excel, there's no substitute for a great database application.
/r/excel gladly helps out with VBA as well, but I wanted to mention there is a dedicated subreddit /r/VBA that is also a helpful community if you need assistance.
Yup!  /r/excel!

We'll help from questions ranging from "How do I Excel?" to "Hey, having problems making this macro work, can someone help out?"

no question is too simple, though I would suggest you search first...

Clippy does mostly automated actions, changing flair, sending reminds to change flair,  keeping track of points, checking for solved and sending reminders about that...

We are still working on getting Clippy a little more involved when it comes to summing him, for example... 

Clippy:VLOOKUP

He should reply...  but that is a long way off.. and still very much a work in progress... 
Have you not sacrificed your complementary summoning chicken yet? 
Hello there, /u/Minor-Threat. We meet at last...
Thanks! We're pretty happy with it! 

Welcome to the sub!
Do it! That'd be a great title to have, especially around the higher management!

Welcome to the sub!
Hooray for more questions to answer!
~~You~~ I have awarded one point to roastedbagel
yay!
[Can't blame you.](http://i.imgur.com/OEeFywd.jpg)

We gained over 2,500 subscribers (almost a 20% increase) in one day because of that post. We're beyond fortunate to get that kind of publicity. 

Welcome to the sub!
Came here from an excel post on /r/engineering  yesterday.

Good stuff.
Before that post, I didn't even realize that an Excel subreddit existed!

Cheers, I'll be dropping by a fair bit!
We are using MySQL for the database, but the data was a mess and I cleaned it up with excel before hand. I'll definitely take a look at /r/VBA. Thanks!
Thanks I'll definitely take a look and poke around that subreddit as well. 
     Syntax: VLOOKUP(lookup_value,table_array,col_index_num,range_lookup)
Whoa whoa whoa. This is amazing. Absolutely perfect.

I literally cannot wait for this feature. Let me know if you need any help with it.
Very cool. Is it really running from within an Excel spreadsheet? If so, is that something that is just left open on your computer all the time or is it hosted somewhere? Curious about the mechanics.
Little known fact: This bot was actually written with a single (though extremely long) Excel formula, which makes heavy use of the CONCATENATE function, a few sprinklings of INDEX and MATCH, as well as voodoo and a pinch of coriander.
[Well done, Clippy.](http://i.imgur.com/JSBTl.gif)
Haha why thank you, I'm honored. I spend too much time browsing /r/HighQualityGifs.
No, it actually a combination of Python and SQL.  Same mechanics as Automoderator except that we host it and can make changes on the fly.

Hmm now that makes me curious if you can connect excel to the reddit api via VBA.


Never the less, it is not run from an Excel Spreadsheet.   As Clippy currently stands it is multiple scrips all running at the same time, but I hope to have them all converted into one eventually...
Well color me blown. 

As a mod (and very avid user/advocate) of /r/automoderator, I'm thoroughly impressed!
See, you're making the mistake again. You know damn well Clippy get's tired if you don't use cinnamon. Damn it Sacamato.
LOL I've been a longtime fan of CONCATENATE, but I just used INDEX and MATCH for the first time a few weeks ago... I could tell it was the beginning of something great, but Clippy goes beyond my wildest dreams!
