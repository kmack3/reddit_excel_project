VBA to search through all worksheets
I've got this to loop through all used cells in each worksheet and it will locate email addresses. It should be useful for you as all of the workbooks look different but the relative location of address, name and TOIL value is the same.

    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
        For Each Cell In ws.UsedRange
            If Cell.Value Like "*@*.*" Then
                MsgBox (Cell.Value)
            End If
        Next Cell
    Next ws

I completely understand your logic, I'm just struggling to apply it to the code.  Is this what you mean?

    
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim Email_Subject, Email_Send_From, Email_Send_To, Email_Body As String
    Dim Mail_Object, Mail_Single As Variant
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
    For Each cell In ws.UsedRange
    If cell.Value Like "*@*.*" Then
    MsgBox (cell.Value)
    End If
    
    
    
    Email_Subject = "Weekly TOIL report"
    Email_Send_From = "TOILreports@mydomain.com"
    Email_Send_To = range("cell.value")
    Email_Body = "Dear " & range("cell.value - 1") & ", you have " & range("cell.value + 1") & " hours left of TOIL."
    
    On Error GoTo debugs
    Set Mail_Object = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set Mail_Single = Mail_Object.CreateItem(0)
    With Mail_Single
        .Subject = Email_Subject
        .To = Email_Send_To
        .Body = Email_Body
        .Send
    End With
    
    Next cell
    Next ws
    
debugs:
    If Err.Description <> "" Then MsgBox Err.Description
    End Sub
 

apologies in advance, VB is not my strong point!
You'll need to use the Offset function. The syntax is Offset(row,column).
So if the email address is in between the name and TOIL value of your users, you'd use it like this:
Sub test_email()
        Dim ws As Worksheet
    
        For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
            For Each Cell In ws.UsedRange
                If Cell.Value Like "*@*.*" Then
    
                        Dim addy As String
                        addy = Cell.Value
    
                        Dim addressee As String
                        addressee = Cell.Offset(-1, 0).Value
    
                        Dim TOIL_Value As String
                        TOIL_Value = Cell.Offset(1, 0).Value
    
                    Exit For
                End If
            Next Cell
        Next ws
    
    Dim Email_Subject, Email_Send_From, Email_Send_To, Email_Body As String
    Dim Mail_Object, Mail_Single As Variant
    
    Email_Subject = "Weekly TOIL report"
    Email_Send_From = "TOILreports@mydomain.com"
    Email_Send_To = addy
    Email_Body = "Dear " & addressee & ", you have " & TOIL_Value & " hours left of TOIL."
    
    Set Mail_Object = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set Mail_Single = Mail_Object.CreateItem(0)
    With Mail_Single
        .subject = Email_Subject
        .To = Email_Send_To
        .body = Email_Body
    End With
    
    End Sub

I haven't yet managed to get it working - it's not doing anything when I assign this to a button, but I'll plug away at it.  Thanks so much for your help!
Do you want to check the emails before you send them? If not, just add

    .Send

Like this:

    Set Mail_Object = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set Mail_Single = Mail_Object.CreateItem(0)
    With Mail_Single
        .subject = Email_Subject
        .To = Email_Send_To
        .body = Email_Body
        .Send
    End With
Almost working - it's sending emails as intended, but the strange thing is, it's only doing this for the very last two worksheets - it's ignoring all the earlier sheets :|

This is the latest I'm using

    Sub test_email()
    
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
            For Each Cell In ws.UsedRange
                If Cell.Value Like "*@*.*" Then
    
                        Dim addy As String
                        addy = Cell.Value
    
                        Dim addressee As String
                        addressee = Cell.Offset(-1, 0).Value
    
                        Dim TOIL_Value As String
                        TOIL_Value = Cell.Offset(1, 0).Value
    
    
    Email_Subject = "Weekly TOIL report"
    Email_Send_From = "TOILreports@mydomain.com"
    Email_Send_To = addy
    Email_Body = "Dear " & addressee & ", you have " & TOIL_Value & " hours left of TOIL."
    
    Set Mail_Object = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set Mail_Single = Mail_Object.CreateItem(0)
    With Mail_Single
        .Subject = Email_Subject
        .To = Email_Send_To
        .body = Email_Body
        .Send
    End With
                    Exit For
                End If
            Next Cell
        Next ws
    
    
    
    Email_Subject = "Weekly TOIL report"
    Email_Send_From = "TOILreports@mydomain.com"
    Email_Send_To = addy
    Email_Body = "Dear " & addressee & ", you have " & TOIL_Value & " hours left of TOIL."
    
    Set Mail_Object = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set Mail_Single = Mail_Object.CreateItem(0)
    With Mail_Single
        .Subject = Email_Subject
        .To = Email_Send_To
        .body = Email_Body
        .Send
    End With
    
    End Sub

In fact, I'm wrong, it's only doing the top name on each worksheet!  Apologies, wasn't reading my mail properly - I'll plug away at it for now :)
Got it - used the following

    
    Sub test_email()
    
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
            For Each Cell In ws.UsedRange
                If Cell.Value Like "*@*.*" Then
    
                        Dim addy As String
                        addy = Cell.Value
    
                        Dim addressee As String
                        addressee = Cell.Offset(-1, 0).Value
    
                        Dim TOIL_Value As String
                        TOIL_Value = Cell.Offset(1, 0).Value
    
                            
                            Email_Subject = "Weekly TOIL report"
                            Email_Send_From = "TOILreports@mydomain.com"
                            Email_Send_To = addy
                            Email_Body = "Dear " & addressee & ", you have " & TOIL_Value & " hours left of TOIL."
    
                        Set Mail_Object = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
                        Set Mail_Single = Mail_Object.CreateItem(0)
                        With Mail_Single
                            .Subject = Email_Subject
                            .To = Email_Send_To
                            .body = Email_Body
                            .Send
                        End With
                   
                End If
            Next Cell
        Next ws
    
    
    
    Email_Subject = "Weekly TOIL report"
    Email_Send_From = "TOILreports@mydomain.com"
    Email_Send_To = addy
    Email_Body = "Dear " & addressee & ", you have " & TOIL_Value & " hours left of TOIL."
    
    Set Mail_Object = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
    Set Mail_Single = Mail_Object.CreateItem(0)
    With Mail_Single
        .Subject = Email_Subject
        .To = Email_Send_To
        .body = Email_Body
        .Send
    End With
    
    End Sub
