I'm trying to combine all the data in my workbook into one worksheet. I've tried to use VBA coding I found on a forum but it's excluding most of my spread sheets (there are 22 total, it's only combining 5 of them).

I do not know code at ALL but have been trying to figure this out for a week now. Anybody know how to make this work?
