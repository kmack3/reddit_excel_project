I may have written an excel macro that could change my career.
Do it for sure. Try to estimate the time it took you to do the task before the macro and after. Come up with total hours saved throughout a year (all stores!), multiply by your hourly wage and present these numbers. That will help the boss offset any bump in pay you might get and show him that you not only come up with solutions but also know how to value them for the company.
I'd just like to point out that most of the people that do things like this in excel and write vba scripts are not actually in IT.  They occupy a not very well defined space with one foot on the business side and one foot in IT and they are very highly in demand in almost all industries.  They are usually called something like: Business analyst, data analyst, operations administrator, VBA developer, business intelligence, financial analyst, accounting analyst, data scientist, excel guru, quant, data reporting analyst etc.

I would argue that these roles are overall a better career path than a straight up developer path.  Developers tend to make more money starting out but cap out fairly early too.  You also learn more about the business side and get to be involved in important decision.

My advice regarding talking to the higher ups would be to just be really positive and upbeat about the company and how you like working there.  Explain that you have a somewhat technical background and thought that there would be a way to speed up the ordering process by automating something in excel and that wow it actually kinda works.  Tell them how long it took before the macro, show them how it works and how much time you save.  Then act excited about sharing it to help save time at some of the other stores.  

It's unlikely they will immediately roll it out to 30 stores so suggest trying it out in one or two of the other stores to see if they find it useful and go from there.  It's also important you don't oversell or take what is perceived to be a 'know-it-all', 'authoritative', or 'I'm way smarter than you' tone.  I wouldn't say "This product will 100% for sure save the company $500k per year based on my calculations" they can do the math.  Say "This product saves me about 1-2 hours of work per day, my boss Susie loves it and it has saved her a ton of time as well. I'm confident that I could help work with our sister stores to get them to save just as much time.

They will probably create some weird position for you that pays more but is not in IT (and probably doesn't pay as much as IT).  Don't let that bum you out though your main objective here is to build your resume.  Use that time to build your excel and VBA skills.  If you can roll it out to the rest of the stores you now have a winning story that can really launch your career.  

Your story: "On your own initiative you single handedly developed, tested, and rolled out an automated ordering system to your whole company that saved the business hundreds of thousands of dollars."

In addition you probably also will be able to say that you solicited and incorporated feedback made presentations to senior management.

Note you will need to take you company's culture into account.  This type of positive upbeat humble approach works really well in California it may not work as well in the north-east where people are used to people.... well acting like jerks.
Realistically, you have to protect yourself or else you could lose the rights to your work.

Lots of employee contracts stipulate that any IP (intellectual property, the umbrella under which your code falls) that you create in connection to your job or the function of your company legally belongs to the company. Even if you made this code on your own time, they could sue you for ownership of the code.

IANAL, but I would advise you to look into ways you can protect ownership rights of your code. Don't go to the higher-ups just yet, as there is a chance that they may force you to relinquish the code and not credit or compensate you. 

Strategically, I believe that your best route of action would be to first make sure your work is protected. Then ask your manager to vouch for you--he'll have a lot more sway with upper management than you do. Failing that, you can bring your code to the IT folk themselves to show them what you've done, and ask if there are any openings that you can enter into. Tell them you're willing to show your skills.
Be careful, anything you design for the company, becomes the companies - including if you made it on your own time - because the original intention was for it to be used for the company. 

Higher up IT staff can take your code, tweak it to meet safety standards and then pass it off as their own and you'll get nothing for it. I did something similar to you, (wrote about it it tales from retai), and so long as you make it clear you want recognition, you want to remain in charge and have complete oversight then pass it upwards. Otherwise it'll get lost in the system and become something someone in IT made.

Hey, I've automated a few processes and created various user forms for the international cooperation I work for. Everything I have done has been on my own and has saved money and time for the company. So far I have received absolutely no recognition for this. No pay increase, no promotion. I still work as a phone monkey who just happens to know VBA and gets used as a result of his na√Øvety. 

Please dude, don't let this happen to you. Show them your creation and make sure you are either promoted or compensated for you efforts.  

Good luck, all the best. 
You've done a good thing and I'm not just here to piss on your biscuits but here goes. 

The IT ppl in your company are probably going to be pretty derisory about your macro. IT folks think in terms of systems well designed and hardened enough to run the entire enterprise.  They will scoff at your tactical solution, even while recognising that they missed the need to do what you did.

But, there us hope. Your macro is like a little chunk of unrefined ore; it contains something precious which is pure business need/logic, but it's bound up in an unusable layer of implementation.

Hey I'm not saying your code is bad, but they will probably think this even before reading it. They won't be interested in your macro as it stands - they will want to extract the pure stuff then implement it in a totally different way, and integrate it with the company's wider IT estate.

The sad fact is depending on how good they are the chances are they will f*** this up, losing the essence of what you created in the process. You will probably find some IT guy will speak up and say, "we tried that before but it didn't work because xyz".

If you want to use this to further your career, then show that you can state the original business need clearly. State the costs of not fixing the issue.  Show the potential savings of fixing it. Say how gosh darned efficient a bunch of similar business units can become by implementing your business idea.

Only then say how you proved this worked by making a macro. 

A previous commenter was talking about jobs with one foot in the business and another in IT. Yes they are enviable,  but rare for a reason- neither camp is comfortable with someone that can think both ways, and some actively attack such people. 

Tl;dr you did good but you will face a bunch of opposition. Prevail and you will achieve an enviable position
It sounds like you are quite a clever coder. It also sounds like you are not being paid very much. If I were you i would ask for a raise based on the calculations described by other comments in this thread, if you don't get it you should leave. At the end of the day this is two weeks work for you that has saved the company you work for a lot of money. If that opportunity is available at your current employment it is available at several other positions for competitors.

Do not bother trying to protect your IP (it is two weeks work for you, aka nothing). your thoughts should be getting a raise or selling yourself to competitors that will pay you more. Do not be afraid to walk away, you have the skills people are looking for and you will be employed for a figure that is commensurate with the amount of $ you can save any potential employer if you have the skills.

As others have said, "sell" it as a cost benefit analysis. Show how much it could help them. Other things to think about: do they have any open positions related to this work? Do you want a job or to sell a product (new role or contract work?) What systems are currently in place? If you get a new job you won't just be supporting your little system but most likely multiple existing systems as well. Lastly, your manager is your best path. Ask them who to talk to and what to say. Always include praise for them and make them look good. If you have the support of a trusted person you have a much better chance of success! 
all the comments here are really good. You said there may already be commercial software for this. Something you could do is research what's already on the market and see what other features they have that you have or could add without much effort and get some ideas on how they market their product. also what their price points are and show what "savings" you're giving them from that aspect as well.
I work in the exact position you are trying to get into.  We run a form of perpetual inventory and use a slew of custom workbooks, I'm interested in what you are comparing the auto order to when getting your next suggested order, items sold/last order/average of last x orders? As far as getting a job goes, writing formulas is a small part of it, you need to be comfortable with networking and security more so than anything else. I would suggest reading up on PCI compliance and sub netting at home while running an ids to monitor traffic to really get some skills you need to advance.
i dont have anything to add other than i wish you massive success dude :')
You might want to consider moving this in access. Access has the advantage of allowing you to make data relational, simplify the user interface, and potentially reduce the amount of development work on your end. Plus you get to learn access and take your skills to the next level.
Op, even if it makes you uncomfortable, you do actually need to present them with a relatively high number for what you want to make. It's starts both sides off on the right foot, they will know not only that you want to make note but also that you know you deserve it. It doesn't have to be a bottom line ultimatum or anything like that, but you really need to come up with a number that values yourself highly.

I got into a similar situation to this myself, I wrote a program to calculate buying for my company, we don't have as many branches as it sounds like you do, but it saved us a bunch of time, and it got me a decent pay raise. From experience, make sure they know you value yourself, even if they can't meet your number, they appreciate people that know what they want.
C# has some really great bindings with excel. 

I highly recommend looking at the stuff by [Jon skeet over on pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/skeet-csharp4). He covers a lot of advanced topics in a very approachable way and it really helped my understanding of how to use C# well.

IF you are going to get a job automating away part of the company, be sure you use good programming habits and write lots of test coverage. resharper+  Ncruch + visual studio pro  should be something on your wishlist if you are going to go the C# direction.

Do the next guy a favor and don't write it in VB if you are given a job.



My recommendation is to turn it into a product on your own time and sell it to similar companies. Corporate won't appreciate the work because they aren't an IT/software company at their heart and will likely mismanage the project due to not having the proper software development manger skills or an open mind along those lines. Most of their software is probably being done by outsourced firms anyway.

Sounds like you got your feet wet in the world of Sales and Operations Planning.  There are too many job opportunities to list.  Every company in every industry has their hands in inventory of one form or another.  The skills required to accurately predict how much of what and when are pretty valuable.  Welcome aboard. 
Make sure they know it was done on your own time and not company time. For many companies, any work done on company time is said to belong to the company, and if you did the work outside of company time, you retain ownership of the script.

Good luck!
Sounds like you have something solid.  Lot of advice here, and I'll chime in with mine.  

I've done something similar that completely automated a report that took an hour and a half each day for my boss.  Took me about a month of 50% time on it to do, but man it was fantastic.  

I'm now a consultant in a big bank and I am around a lot of management and put together presentations myself for these people.  Here's my short list of $0.02

**Presenting this to management:**

- I would avoid doing a live example unless requested.  Put together an example explaining the process before and one after
- Showing cost benefit can be useful but do it in a very transparent way.  Show the numbers you're using and estimating.  
- Don't show that you could eliminate positions but frame it around increasing efficiency for the existing people.  Being a threat to other people's livelihood is not a good position to be in early in your career.  
- Explain how this method can be applied to other things too, if the data is available.  

**Other points:**

- This could be your ticket to corporate but they probably have a bunch of people doing stuff like this already, so try to frame it as a tool and set it up in a way others can use it too, but make clear you can create these kinds of tools for multiple processes.  If you don't know how to, you can figure it out pretty easily by the sounds of it.  
- Speak clearly and to the point.  Act confident, whether you are or are not and don't be afraid to say you don't know to a question if they ask but inform them you can find out.
May I ask where did you learn excel so fast? What website or tutorials did you use?
I don't have much to add that others haven't covered other than this: Keep it up. This is how I went from making 12 dollars an hour as a front line customer facing service individual in health insurance, to now making 75k/year creating reports and writing SQL queries for institution-wide problems/solutions over the past 7 years. Like you, it all started with an excel VBA macro.
>When you take everything in to account, automated ordering doesn't have much impact on gross profit. 

This is true, but what you have done should be a good proof of concept for your employer and hopefully they'll further utilize your skills. 

When I was 20 I made a macro to automate 3 hours of work every day and eventually saved a ton of money. I got a pat on the back and waited 4 years until I had a new boss that needed my skills. I'm working on several projects for different managers now and we've been discussing my VBA work being full time. 

When you can do cool stuff in excel, you're worth your weight in gold to the right person! 
how is everything so far ?
Don't get taken for granted.

It sounds like you would really benefit from getting a degree.
Thanks for your response. The only problem with that is that the orders actually take me the same amount of time but they are much more accurate. All the data the the macro uses needs to be entered in manually. If I had access to the company's database then all of that information could be filled out automatically. If a system like this was to be put in place there would be no need for order writers at all.

> That will help the boss offset any bump in pay you might get and show him that you not only come up with solutions but also know how to value them for the company.

forget pay bump, ask for a cut of the license fee for your intellectual property, sit on your ass and cash checks.

source:  the devs who designed our council's shitty new system are basically doing this
Exactly this. I did something very similar at my company. While upper management might not know what VBA is or how it works, they definitely understand numbers.

Give them realistic numbers, an easy method for them to adopt this application in different branches, and make it as easy as possible to use.
Bravo. Now up the diabolicalness.

Also, OP: people tend to give "magical excel wizard" aura to people who do this, so they tend not to understand *how* you do it, but know that you created a result which removes some pain point they have. So you get space to "do your thing" which gives them "results". Pay very close attention to who is going to be your boss/champion/person you will be reporting to. 


Hey OP, I am Financial Analyst/execl wizard and I really enjoy what I do. I would recommend it as a career path.
I started as an accountant and then pivoted to become an excel wizard.
However it is easy to get into this area with a more technical background. My advice would be to get some experience with SQL and then move from there.
That's exactly it - I did this (I've built an entire automatic financial reporting package out of excel macros that pull our GL and easily generate all sort of reports in minutes, rather than days) and have a name for myself at my company.

I highly recommend learning who you'll be reporting to, who's seeing it, and understanding that you don't know most anything.  You'll be learning a lot about the business and getting into something you're uneducated in.  This is the fun part!
please elaborate much more on this. i want to be this guy
Meh. Two weeks of work on an excel macro? That's worth a lot less than the goodwill and advancement  opportunities this affords him.  From the sound of it, this is something you'd pay a freelancer less than $1000 to create.


Thank you. I'll definetly have to look in to that.
There's no such thing as fool proof. I've had it as simple as "fill in the data, press this button." and I still had a few coworkers tell me it's broken. 
The macro uses the average units sold in a user given time period. Every week at the start of a new sale price I take inventory for everything that I order. It takes a lot in to account and there are many variables such as which days the order needs to last through and for what sale price, current inventory level, desired inventory level, case sku, etc... It can also detect whether or not a sales data point needs to be excluded from the average. For example, if an item runs out before the next order comes then it can be excluded so that the macro doesn't pick up bad information. 

I already had some experience with programming so all I had to do was look up the syntax for the functions that I needed.  I just looked things up as I needed them. Once I had a working prototype I started from scratch and gave my code better structure and added a bit more functionality. I used Excel Easy to find everything that I needed. It's not like I learned everything there is to know about Excel in 2 weeks. Project Euler helped me out immensely when I was first learning how to program. If you can wrap your mind around some of those problems, getting a spreadsheet to do what you want it to do is a piece of cake. 
Definitely frame it in the context of how much money it will save the company.

>> but they are much more accurate. 

So the macro saves the company money by not ordering too much stock (in which the company loses money by not selling stock) and not ordering too few stock (in which case the company loses money by either not selling as much as they can, or spending time to order more).

>>  If a system like this was to be put in place there would be no need for order writers at all.

This would save the company money in obvious ways.  But you should be careful with this part, as it seems like it would make part of your job redundant.

If you want to move out of your position, highlight the ways your product could be improved and maintained, and propose that you be moved into a position where you do that full time (or near-full time).  Think of ways your product could be scaled up to have more functionality, ensuring you have plenty of work you can do.  Linking it with the company database, like you suggested, is one thing you can suggest.
Also estimate cost savings from more accurate orders, including costs associated from reordering, returns, handling and stocking from secondary deliveries etc etc. Stack the numbers in your favour and don't forget to multiply by 30!
Frame it assuming you had access to the database, and use an hourly salary several rungs more senior than your own
What you have to show is the impact of your macro, whatever that may be.  Also, remember to proactively address any concerns they might have (what risks to the operation does this present). 

I did something similar in a corporate environment.  You would have thought that I showed them black magic when I showed them how I was shaving 60% of the time required to do a task.  Unfortunately, I'm now the "excel expert" and everyone in the entire division comes to me with questions and help....
How do you get the data to punch into excel? Do you use a web app to retrieve it from a database?  If so, you may be able to automate pulling the information into excel as well. 
Get access to the transactional database for the company. Take a data dump of last years sales and pivot it out. 

Take the current years sales and create a projection for the remainder of the year for ordering numbers. For example 9+3 for financial year from YTD. 

Do the same for previous year and show YonY increase in accuracy and therefore savings for the company from more accurate ordering and possible agreements with suppliers for structured ordering.

Holding your boss hostage the moment you write your first applicable script is not going to get you anywhere. That might work if you've built something truly unique but OP said he spent two weeks (presumably in his limited free time) blundering through the script as a vb beginner. This likely means that, while potentially transformative for the business, the script can probably be duplicated or improved by a semi experienced Dev. If the dialogue devolves into an "IP" discussion then leadership will be more inclined to look at professional services over giving op a shot.
Yeah but isn't the FA field difficult to enter without a financial background or finance degree?
Just chiming in here to strongly 2nd buxlo122's suggestion to learn SQL.  SQL + Excel + VBA in the hands of a motivated progammer/analyst can completely transform a business by increasing efficiency, profit margins, and helping make better decisions.
Well it's going to depend on what industry you are in but all companies have data somewhere that needs to be analyzed or manual processes that could be automated whether they know it or not.  What industry are you in?

Most companies don't even know what's possible with these tools so they will almost never just hire an excel guru out of nowhere.  Typically some office worker excel monkey will be curious enough to figure out how to do something and then boom they've stumbled upon a template or macro that saves 10 people 2 hours per week.  Or they merge some operational data they find that their financial data and will discover that 2 of their products are making 40% of their profit and 2 other items are losing significant amounts of money... eventually leading to a much more profitable company.

Anyway to be 'this guy' the analyst you have to be in a position where you are dealing with data a lot like accounting, reporting, book keeping, operational record keeping or something like that.  Also you have to have access to someone who makes decisions.  Then what you do is try to understand the data really well and start poking around to find where all the other data you don't deal with is located.  Try to bring the data together into some kind of database or just excel if you're desperate and combine it novel ways that would help give insight into the business problems your company is facing.  

If you want to be the excel macro guru then you need to have access to computer users that have to have a time consuming manual task over and over.  Then you can write a macro to automate the process.  

The only problem with this is that often there are only a few processes that can be automated so eventually you may not have anything left to automate.  So I'd recommend leveraging your excel/VBA skills to add in data analysis and reports for management.
It was two weeks of obsession over this macro. You're right though, as it is now, its not worth a lot. 
OP you've done some outstanding work. You deserve to be proud of yourself, and should use it to benefit your employer and yourself as much as possible.

Please don't dwell on the IP though, there's basically nothing there.

If you're interested in solving bigger problems of this nature, you might consider getting into financial modelling.
Don't worry too much about "protecting your work". The script is custom so they can't sell it to anyone else and since you built it without much VBA knowledge I'm fairly sure you are the only one who could reasonably support the product. Essentially without the relationship between you and the store the product is useless. 
I wouldn't push too hard for the IP rights given your position and the fact that it takes the same amount of time with or without the macro. Use it as leverage for a new position. I.e. "Here are the numbers, here's what we can save, here's how easy it is to use. I did it on my own time but I'm looking to enter a position where my skills can be more useful for the company." Just something like that.

This is similar to what happened to me. It's super exciting, and congratulations on the hard work!!
Sounds a lot like what I've used in the past, I certainly never had any department heads designing anything so detailed though so kudos to you. Luckily I've moved to a pos and back end that tracks all that info and takes auto bid files. One thing I might suggest if you aren't already doing it is to add some margin analysis and price suggestion based on cost change, that's what impressed the hire ups in my experience.
Oh, I understand, thanks for responding. By the way, congratulations on your spreadsheet! Hard work pays off, I wish you the best and I hope that you can get on the position and department you want.
making part of his job redundant is exactly what he needs to do if he wants to stop being a receiving clerk and start being a Dev/IT analyst.
"Hey Bob, I need help with a chart in excel. I'm sending you an email on it right now."

*Please see attached graph. I need to create a straight line going across the middle of it.*

I think the most fun stuff though is when someone with no Excel knowledge asks you to do something on the borderline of impossible. It's a fun challenge but then they don't really understand how much work went into it and constantly break it...
wouldnt there be some way of 'licensing your work' ? become a consultant or some such thing
Business Analyst here who works for the Finance Department. I recently got a few promotions despite my not having acquired a degree, but I was pretty much told that my future opportunities within the company would be limited/non-existent without a degree in finance. So now I'm working full-time while going to school full-time.
One OP gets into IT (officially or not), if the company offers tuition reimbursement, an  IT degree would definitely fit the "relates to associate's position" criterion that many companies have.  Even coursework at a technical college could be justified.
There are great consulting jobs you can get as a SQL report writer. Hard to get clients but a very profitable niche.
I was in your shoes 10 years ago.  Working for a small food manufacturer, I was able to automate the creation of invoices in Quickbooks using an Excel macro.  I built an Excel model to predict order quantities for Trader Joe's, because they would place their order after we started our production run, and we wanted to minimize overages.  I used macros to make other people's jobs easier.

This all (as well as other system admin skills/work I picked up) catapulted me into the position of implementing the new ERP system when the company finally decided to grow up.  In the course of it all, I learned some SQL, Crystal Reports, a bit of Linux, more sysadmin skills, and a lot of Excel/VBA.

My advice is to not worry about retaining IP on these early projects.  As others said, they are too specialized to be salable outside of this business.  The worth to you is the knowledge and skill you acquired in doing the work.  As other's said, quantify the gains in efficiency and accuracy to your managers, and look for places where you can use your skills to help the business.

They will probably try to get the most out of your skill for as little as possible, so for each project, document the time you save yourself and other employees.  Look at job descriptions for positions like Data Analyst, Systems Analyst, VBA coder, etc. and find ones that fit those parts of what you do.  Look at their salary's and use that as a guide when asking for your next increase.
...only if the management he presents his solution to is competent.
I disagree.  If someone asked, "I want to transition from receiving clerk to IT in my company," sound advice would NOT be, "Make receiving clerk redundant."  Way more important would be, "Prove your IT worth."  In this case, the 2 events (proving his current job redundant and moving into another sector) are slightly related.  But if OP merely proves his current job redundant, he'll be out of a job.  If he's going to prove his current job redundant, *and he wants to move into IT,* he needs to *also* prove his IT value.  
Maybe, but since I created it while at work they would likely claim it as their own.  The funny thing is that I "taught" myself VBA through necessity and is ridiculously inefficient and kludgy. 
Interesting. Now is it Finance specifically or do you just need a Bachelor's to open the door to upward mobility?
Yea it's hard to get clients because companies don't know that they need these people I think.  However they are blown away by the results it seems like an area ripe for some high quality targeted marketing.
Not really.  If his current management is incompetent, then he just needs to switch jobs.  But if he can't make part of his job redundant, then he himself isn't competent to make the switch.  In other words, making his own job redundant proves that he is able to make the move into a more highly skilled function.  Whether or not management recognizes that is, while not irrelevant to his situation, at least a separate issue.  
> sound advice would NOT be, "Make receiving clerk redundant." Way more important would be, "Prove your IT worth."

Sure.  Implicit in my statement was that OP would be making his job "redundant" by proving his IT worth, i.e. creating macros to automate parts of his job and/or improve the accuracy of his work.

And here, "redundant" really means make the role cost less money, either by taking less hours or improving productivity through more accurate orders translating into less spoilage, etc.
I would say you would want an accounting degree or try develop accounting experience on the job.
Alternatively you could try gain some experience then try for an MBA program.
Right-O.
Right but that's the conventional route. I was trying to figure out what to do if you're already in the work force.
