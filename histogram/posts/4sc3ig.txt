Allow user interaction with your spreadsheet mid macro â€“ by tricking your VBA code into pausing
This might be exactly what I've been looking for! I have a VBA script that runs through a bunch of sheets, plotting data and asking the user to guess the intersection of two lines in a MsgBox for each sheet. The problem is that the plot doesn't display before asking the user for input, so all they see is a blank rectangle instead of a plot of two lines. However, the plot DOES display in debug mode. I'm on mobile now so I can't check, but I think I can adapt this to work for my needs. Thanks! 
It's a good idea to add a timer to the Do loop to auto-exit the macro gracefully after 10-15 seconds or less. This way the user doesn't have to remember that the macro is running if they step away from their desk.

One cool thing you can do with this is create custom selection boxes independent of cells. You can select objects, individual points on a scatter plot, cells, or anything else with (x,y) coordinates. All you need to do is hijack Excel's Insert Shape function (no userform hack required!):

    #If VBA7 And Win64 Then
        '64-bit Office
        Public Declare PtrSafe Function GetTickCount Lib "kernel32" () As LongLong
    #Else
        '32-bit Office
        Public Declare Function GetTickCount Lib "kernel32" () As Long
    #End If

    Public Sub GetUserSelection()
        ...
        Application.CommandBars.ExecuteMso "ShapeRectangle"
        
        On Error GoTo ErrHandler
        Application.EnableCancelKey = xlErrorHandler
        lStartTick = GetTickCount
        lEndTick = GetTickCount + (lNumberOfSeconds * 1000)
        Do
            DoEvents
            
            lCurrTick = GetTickCount
            
            If TypeOf Selection Is Rectangle Then
                bShapeCreated = True
            End If
        Loop Until lCurrTick >= lEndTick Or bShapeCreated = True
        ...
    End Sub
You need to show the form modelessly, or the user can't touch the sheet behind it:

    f_wait.Show vbModeless
Hi!

No problem, let me know if you have any problems!

Hi, 

Thanks for your message! 

Instead of adding modeless to the code, I change a userform setting. 

See Step 2.
