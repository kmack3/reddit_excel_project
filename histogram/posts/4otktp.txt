Showcase: Barcode generator without add-ins/fonts. (code 128-B)
can you repost to filedropper.com? the link failed for me.

Pretty cool. I spent weeks doing something similar with A & C only to not be able to use it for what I was building it for. I haven't checked your code, but it looks like you've used 128B even for the long numbers. You can switch to 128C to make the barcode more compact for long strings of numbers.
Cool.  Saving this for a rainy day in retail land to play with it.  Thank you.

nice work.  years ago i had an issue at work where we suddenly needed barcode creation capability.  Middle managers and marketing guys were scrambling for crappy barcode fonts and shit like that off the web.  I just used the form designer in Acrobat Professional to make them in-house without costing anything.  Didn't occur to me to do it in excel.
I am using this. It works great for me.ï»¿

Yea I did 128B instead of 128C because most of the barcodes I have to create are often not long strings of numbers. And to be honest, it was way easier for me to do B, didn't have to figure out the double digit extracting process. 

I don't really have code, it's formulas and conditional formatting! Maybe I'll redo it in VBA someday. 
Hmm, hard question. I guess it is possible if someone developed it. At the moment I am not aware of such a thing existing in Excel. Can't really find 3d barcode generators on google either (haven't searched super long though).
