Can someone give a practical example of some of the functionality behind using Rexcel?

I have a feeling that if I don't understand immediately what I can use it for than I probably don't even need it, but I'm curious and the website isn't quite enlightening me.
i guess i prefer being just excel.

So using R gives you 'roid rage?
I <3 R

Now if only configuration wasn't such a pain that i could use it in all the spreadsheets my team uses. But then I spend more time as IT guy than doing my day job.
Which city? I'm sure there are people on here that could guide you toward some resources. Also, check out r/learnprogramming if you ever have questions about anything programming including R
