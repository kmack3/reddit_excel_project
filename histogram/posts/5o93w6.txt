What are the best Add-ins for Microsoft Excel 2016?
Look up ASAP Utilities. It's free for personal use and covers almost any function you could need. 

Also, if you're running with massive data sets, PowerPivot

The add-ins are mostly free.
Why the /r/Excel add-in of course

You could use MATLAB add-in for stats related solutions but that requires you install MATLAB as well
I use Kutools. It's paid but you get a 60 day trial with full features so you have plenty of time to see if it suits your needs. 

I find it great for formatting lots of data and quicker than trying to write a macro in most instances.
The Custom UI Editor Tool, for modifying the XML associated with the QAT / Ribbon.  Not an Add-In per se, but it came up the other day in another thread, and is exceedingly useful for creating custom applications and their UI's.

If you like/use Solver then SolverTable is pretty powerful.

Love ASAP utilities.  I told people at the last 2 companies I worked for about it...IT downloaded the 30 day trial and then bought us subscriptions afterward.

tempting to use, just the whole "Only free for home projects, schoolwork and charitable organizations" company keeps warning not to mess with this. could be a big problem if used at work with out a license. 

Amazing ! Thanks 
I installed several of them and ama getting prompts to purchase a key for 29 bucks.
Not exactly new anymore, lol.
