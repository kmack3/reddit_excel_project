How to classify the data like this?
Not really - I would say you could use Consolidate but the "From" is garbage where it's located. You could certainly attempt something crazy from within Get & Tranform (PowerQuery) but that may not be worth the effort as well. VBA could be a likely solution though I'm always hesitant to recommend that and would say - can you go to the source of your data and ask them to format it in database format (Fields and Records).
bit complicated. Assume your first table is from A1 to D9. H1 is "from" and I1 is "USA" while H2 is name and I2 is age. 

have this formula at H3

    =IFERROR(IF(H$2<>"",INDEX(INDEX($A$2:$C$10,,MATCH(H$2,$A$1:$C$1,0)),SMALL(INDEX((INDEX(E$1:$Z$1,MATCH("name",E$2:$Z$2,0)+1)=$D$2:$D$10)*(MATCH(ROW($A$2:$A$10),ROW($A$2:$A$10)))+(INDEX(E$1:$Z$1,MATCH("name",E$2:$Z$2,0)+1)<>$D$2:$D$10)*1048577,0,0),ROW(A1))),""),"")

drag across, then drag down. 
Not sure what you're tyring to do with the data - the tables to the right are grouped by "from". If you're trying to do the same thing but automatically, pivottables would work. One of the options for a pivot table is to filter. 
> Consolidate 

Thanks for your help, the the formula was unable to show the name.

btw, it there have any easier solution?
