A macro for copying and pasting multiple cells a different number of times each. (Will give gold to anyone who can solve this for me).
This works beautifully for me.

Load your file, press ALT+F11. This loads the VBA window.

Click Insert > Module.

Then, paste this into the white window that appears.

    Sub CopySongs()
    
        Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
        Dim s1 As Worksheet, s2 As Worksheet
        Dim i As Long, lr1 As Long, lr2 As Long
        
        Set s1 = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
        Set s2 = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2")
    
        With s1
    
            lr1 = .Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
            
            'LOOPS FROM ROW 2 TO LAST ROW OF SHEET1
            For i = 2 To lr1
                
                If .Cells(i, 5) > 0 Then
                    
                    Application.StatusBar = "Copying " & .Cells(i, 1)
                    
                    'FIND NEXT ROW ON SHEET 2
                    lr2 = s2.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row + 1
                    
                    .Rows(i).Copy Destination:=s2.Range(s2.Rows(lr2), s2.Rows(lr2 + .Cells(i, 5) - 1))
                
                End If
            
            Next
                
            
        End With
        
        Application.ScreenUpdating = True
        Application.StatusBar = False
        
        MsgBox "It is done.", vbInformation
    
    End Sub



After that, close the VBA window. Press ALT+F8 when on the first sheet. Click on CopySongs then OK - look at the status bar and wait for the done prompt. You can use a COUNTIF formula on the first sheet to count how many entries appear on the second sheet for each record (I did that, took me 5 seconds and every entry matched).

When you're done, copy the sheet out into it's own workbook (right click on the tab, select copy, change the drop down to new workbook) and then save as a CSV file.

And don't give me gold, that's how not how this sub works. 

Ps it's in Excel format, I forgot to save as a csv. You'll have to do that yourself.

This is pretty easy. I'm about to head to work, but if this isn't solved by someone else by the time I get off work I'll take a stab at it. 
This looks very promising! I have followed what you said and it looks perfect. 
Thank you so much!

Now I have the csv file, but when I open it, it just looks like a regular excel spreadsheet. Universal Scrobbler requires this sort of format into the bulk scrobbler:

"Jeff Buckley", "Last Goodbye", "Grace", "Jeff Buckley", "275"

Is there a way to apply those speech marks and to get the commas in as well?

Thank you so much. I've spent the last hour pasting the csv in segments as I think there is a limit on how much universal scrobbler will accept.

I think I gave you gold? I bought it but I'm not sure if it takes a while to show up. 

Thanks again. You have made my week :)
Don't open the CSV in Excel - open it in notepad. Just open notepad and drag and drop it in. It doesn't need the quotation marks either.

Excel automatically strips away the commas and applies it's own formatting to look pretty.

Thank you very much!
I thought that might be the case. Will have a look now!

Yeah, excel is the destroyer of CSV files.  Notepad++ is my go to for all things text editing.
