Excel Games
I have a roulette game nearly done.  I need to figure out the more complex betting like street (row), corner, and those types, but the basic betting, including the "outside", is done.

I made Tetris about 6 years ago. I ended up talking about it on Australian radio a few years ago, which is crazy.

You can download it here.

Nice, I also made BlackJack a little while back.  I found pictures of all 52 cards and put them on a separate sheet, then referenced the pictures in the game so you can see what cards you have.  I made a betting section on the side but I always wanted to add some sort of Statistics section on the side like you have to show winning percentage or your odds during the current game.  Never got around to it.
