is there a way to get Conditional formatting to color a cell red if 0, green if 100, yellow for any other number? (excel 2007)

Yeah, using [conditional formatting](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Create-flexible-effective-conditional-formats-in-Excel-2007-bb709a14-f6e0-4abd-b4cb-6458c5def399), you might have to create 3 separate rules if you don't want it to be a gradient.  
Worth noting that you can save yourself the most difficult of the rules by having the cell yellow to begin with. 
Thanks!  this is perfect.   For some reason I had it in my mind I had to have just one rule that did it all... I shouldn't do spreadsheets before my first cup of coffee.....    

Thank you once more
