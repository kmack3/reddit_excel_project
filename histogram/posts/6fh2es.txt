How to automate the merging of multiple spreadsheets?
Try this: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Combine-files-in-a-folder-with-Combine-Binaries-Power-Query-94b8023c-2e66-4f6b-8c78-6a00041c90e4
You can automate the opening of all the Excel files if they always have the same name/location (or the name is consistent in some other way)

Alternately you can just open them all manually and run this code in your "Master"

    Sub MergeWBS()
        Application.DisplayAlerts = False
        
        Dim wbk As Workbook, Master As Workbook
        Dim ws As Worksheet
        
        Set Master = ThisWorkbook
         
        For Each wbk In Workbooks
            If wbk.Name <> ThisWorkbook.Name Then
                For Each ws In wbk.Worksheets
                    ws.Copy After:=Master.Sheets(Master.Sheets.Count)
                Next ws
                wbk.Close
            End If
        Next wbk
        
        Application.DisplayAlerts = True
    End Sub
