What does "~~" mean in Excel
it's a search string. The formula is probably used to find the location of the 4th / in a string. To do this the formula will substitute the 4th / in the c2 cell with a " ~~ " then locate that number. 

Probably, the formula results in an error because the ~ symbol is often used as a wildcard exception. Use a different formula such as 

    =SEARCH(" @@ ",SUBSTITUTE(Data!C2,"/"," @@ ",4))
