Totalling pieces for in between time frames.
I'm having a little bit of a hard time following the format you have, but it sounds like you can have a SUMIFS formula that just says 

    =SUMIFS([Pieces Column],[Wait Time Column],">="&[Wait Time Min],[Wait Time Column],"<="&[Wait Time Max])
I will try that tonight and let you know. Thank you
