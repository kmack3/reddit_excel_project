Want a fun brain teaser? Try making a Tabula Recta!
Sorry to segue from the discussion but is there a way to find other "challenges" in this sub? It seems like a great way to improve my excel abilities but when I try searching based on flair it also includes "solved" posts.
=CHAR(MOD(COLUMN()+ROW()-2,26)+63)

Most obvious solution, is it the shortest?  I don't know enough about excel to know if there are any better references than COLUMN() and ROW().

Also using LibreOffice so it might be different :p
Hi,  

i found a way with formulas it works but can probably be optimised:  

http://imgur.com/a/jgiM1  

    =CHAR(IF(COLUMN(CR1)+ROW(A1)>122;COLUMN(CR1)+ROW(A1)-26;COLUMN(CR1)+ROW(A1)))
My most clever idea is:

Why does it have to be A-Z? Why not let the user choose with which Letter to start and to end? So, I made a code with 2 input boxes:

    Sub TabulaRecta()
    LetterStart = InputBox("With which letter do you like to start?")
    LetterEnd = InputBox("With which letter do you like to end?")
    ls = Asc(LetterStart)
    le = Asc(LetterEnd)
    For l = 1 To le - ls + 1
    For s = 1 To le - Asc(LetterStart) + 1
    Cells(l, s).Value = Chr(ls)
    If ls = le Then ls = Asc(LetterStart) - 1
    ls = ls + 1
    Next s
    ls = ls + 1
    Next l
    End Sub

Not as clean as most of y'all's, but I was thinking it needed to have the entire alphabet in a single cell, not as one character per cell.

    =CONCATENATE(RIGHT("ZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY",26-MOD(ROW(),26)),LEFT("ZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXY",MOD(ROW(),26)))

I added some MOD functions so you wouldn't get an error if you copied it past row 26.
Here's my solution in vba

Sub TableRecta()

For i = 0 To 25

    For j = 0 To 25

    Cells(i + 1, j + 1).Value = "=Char(" & (i + j) Mod 26 + 65 & ")"

    Next j 

Next i 

End Sub

Is it cheating to have a "seed" row?  Put ABC...XYZ into A1, put:

    =CONCATENATE(RIGHT(A1,1),LEFT(A1,LEN(A1)-1))

Into A2 and drag down.

This works only if you start in A1:

=CHAR(ROW()+63+COLUMN()-IF(ROW()+COLUMN()>27,26,0))

I decided to long it out, but it works in Excel from A1 to Z26 (I didn't try it before)

    =IF(CODE(CHAR(ROW()+65-1+COLUMN()-1))>90,CHAR(CODE((CHAR(ROW()+65-1+COLUMN()-1)))-90+64),CHAR(ROW()+65-1+COLUMN()-1))

Edit: Tidier, but I feel like I'm cheating, version.

    =CHAR(IF(COLUMN(BL1)+ROW(A1)>90,COLUMN(BL1)+ROW(A1)-26,COLUMN(BL1)+ROW(A1)))
I initially got the same solution as /u/mmrnmhrm, so I thought I'd try being a bit more literal and found this solution:

* In A1: the value "A" (no quotes needed)
* In B1: =UNICHAR(UNICODE(A1)+1) ... copy across to Z1
* In A2: =B1 ... copy down and across to Y26
* In Z2: =A1 ... copy down to Z26

Didn't know about the UNICHAR() and UNICODE() functions before, so I learned something. Bring on the further challenges!
A1 = ABCDEFG...
A2 = RIGHT(A1, 25) & LEFT(A1, 1)
auto fill to A26
ANSWER
So far all the comments I've seen result in only one character per cell.  This formula works by populating the full answer in each cell.  This works from A1 -> A26
    =RIGHT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",26-ROW()+1)&LEFT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",ROW()-1)

I'm working on the *drag* *right* to cell Z26 version but I need to keep working on it.  So far I have this for the A1 -> Z26 soultion; it breaks at C26 for obvious reasons
    =RIGHT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",26+(1-ROW())-(COLUMN()-1))&LEFT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",ROW()-1+(COLUMN()-1))


    Public Sub TabulaRecta()
    Dim i As Integer
    Dim j As Integer
    
    For i = 1 To 26
        For j = 1 To 26
            If (i + j > 27) Then
                Cells(i, j).Value = Chr(37 + i + j)
            Else
                Cells(i, j).Value = Chr(63 + i + j)
            End If
        
        Next j
    Next i
    
    End Sub

http://imgur.com/a/NDLiE
    =CHAR(65+MOD(MOD(COLUMN(A1)-1,26)+MOD(ROW(A1)-1,26),26))

Edit: Bah now that I look through the answers I see mmrnmhrm's answer and realize my inner mod's are totally repetitive. :(
=RIGHT(A1,25)&LEFT(A1,1)

?
I put this down below but thought I would post it as well. Here is my solution:

    =IF(ROW(A94)<27,RIGHT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",MOD(ROW(A94),26)-1)&LEFT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",27-MOD(ROW(A94),26)),"")

I would love to see more challenges like this.

Edit: Really wanted to throw that IF statement in there. My life would be incomplete without IF statements.
Hmm, that's strange. I'll look into it!
Bizarre.  Quick-and-dirty fix:

Just posted [another challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/4x1tp8/liked_trying_to_print_a_tabula_recta_how_about_an/) by the way!
I'm guessing your formula starts in `A3`?
Clever solution!

Which version of Excel are you running? Excel 2016 didn't like the `;` in the `IF` statement. 
I did the same thing with a seed.

=CONCATENATE(MID(A1,2,25),LEFT(A1,1))
I had to blow it out to understand it, but nice thinking! I originally thought along the same lines. 

Here's the blown out code for others trying to understand it:

    =IF(
      CODE(
        CHAR(
          ROW()+65-1+COLUMN()-1
        )
      ) > 90, 
      CHAR(
        CODE(
          (
            CHAR(
              ROW()+65-1+COLUMN()-1
            )
          )
        ) - 90 + 64),
      CHAR(
        ROW() + 65 - 1 + COLUMN()-1
      )
    )
How about this?

    =RIGHT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",MOD(27-ROW(A1),27))&LEFT("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",27-MOD(27-ROW(A1),27))

That would get rid of the A1 cell by putting it into the formula. Could even put an if statement in there to prevent it from working past row 26.

Edit: Formatting and realized that the characters were advancing in the wrong direction.
Adding to this, B2 = MID($A1, COLUMN(A1), 1) 

You can auto fill to column AA:26 if you want each letter in its own cell. 
Very similar to [my solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/4vrzk7/want_a_fun_brain_teaser_try_making_a_tabula_recta/d611js3)..

Glad I wasn't the only one trying to put the whole alphabet into a single cell. :)  I also forgot that "&" could concatenate strings!
Yup, that'll work for now. Thanks mate.
Nice! Thanks for the heads up.
No.  It starts in A1

I edited the post.  My original solution of =CHAR(MOD(COLUMN()+ROW(),26)+65) was getting ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWX?@, but it works now.....

Also, COLUMN() + ROW() of A1 = 2 in my configuration ... (I am using LibreOffice)
Oh I'm using 2013 but french version my bad you would have to replace the ; by , as argument separators
How'd you make it go boom?
Yeah, it's not the shortest but it definitely works and makes more sense to me. It was interesting to see that you had your string start at Z instead of A. 
Still getting ?@...
Ah, gotcha. [Here's what your original](http://i.imgur.com/cFGNbd8.png) looked like for me. If I just moved it down to A3, it worked like a charm. 

Nice solution!
Nice! Didn't know that!

Do y'all use commas as decimal separators? 
[Explosives.](http://giant.gfycat.com/HeartfeltJauntyAntipodesgreenparakeet.gif) 

And Sublime Text Editor.

But mostly explosives.
Yeah, pretty much only to get rid of a "-1" in the equation and make things a little shorter.  It was just the first solution I thought of when I had my math a little off and my strings were starting with the letter B instead of A. :)

In Excel, I think you just have to adjust the 63 to a 65 and it'll work.
To get rid of the ?@, you have to make it so that COLUMN() + ROW() = 0 in column A1.  I adjust by subtracting 2 from COLUMN + ROW in the fixed version.
Yes for us thousands separator is a space and decimals are separated with commas like that 10 000,25
[Here's another way...](http://excelformulabeautifier.com/)
I had to use this in excel: `=CHAR(MOD(COLUMN()+ROW()-2;26)+65)`

The two differences are:

- 65 at the end instead of 63
- Semicolon instead of comma between 2 and 26
That explains it! 
yes but unfortunately I think we are very few in this situation, I should make a copy/paste to explain it in all my posts, it would avoid a lot of misscomprehension here! :)
Tip for you:

I'm struggling helping with formulas in this sub, too. This is a very good tool to make your own formulas in french and then translate them to english
Thank you very much! My excel is in english so I do not have issues with  formula names but when I type a formula with ";" instead of "," I get questions and your link can convert it so no more questions :)
