Office 2016 Public Preview (with Excel 2016) now available for free download
FYI I have found that it crashes randomly, autosave appears to not work, and printing to PDF makes it completely shit itself.
In case anyone is on the fence, you can't have Office 2016 installed side-by-side with Office 2013, and you'll have to uninstall Office 2013 before installing Office 2016. 
Hey this is great!  Thanks for the link, but would you mind changing this post to a discussion or advertisement vice unsolved?

Thanks!
I see they are implementing shared worksheet features to all spreadsheets now
Not true for Mac users (like me).  I have both installed.
That sucks.
Done!
I like that but they need to add support for GDrive and Dropbox before that particular feature becomes useful to me :)
