5 little tips that will double your efficiency
Paste special is alt+e+s+v for those not watching the video 
CTRL+ALT+V, V Enter I find is faster for Paste Special.
You missed "don't spend all your time on reddit".  That's one little tip which more than doubles my efficiency.

Which reminds me ... back to work!
When he gets to the "Paste Special" screen and says he presses "F" for Formulas and "V" for Values and that he doesn't have the others memorized (at 2:10)...

... just look at the text and the value with the underlined letter is what you would click to select it.  It's VERY commonly set up like that in any Microsoft window. 

EDIT: I'll also add - he must be annoying to sit beside. He sounds like he slams his keyboard keys every chance he can get. 
Good tips to keep in mind. Why is the video slightly blurry?
How hard are you punching your keyboard? :D

Also, great video!
this is great!
Last Thursday i did 1,2,&4 and Alt +tab so much that my left hand is still hurting. 
Here's some that I use all the time  
Alt+r+p+s password protect/unprotect sheet  
Alt+r+p+w password protect/unprotect book  
Alt+h+o+u+h unhide sheet  
ctrl+pgup / pgdown to cycle through sheets
It says Alt+e+s and then select the one you want from the menu. The v would be selecting one of the options.
Another quick way to paste values is to right-click and type 'v'. I find that a lot easier than a 4-button alt combo.
Or Menu Key +s+v if you prefer it.
Is this an old shortcut?  I always use ALT-H-V-V for paste as values and ALT-H-V-T for paste transpose (my 2 go-to's).  If I hit ALT-E I get a little popup saying "Continue typing the menu key sequence from an earlier version of Office of press ESC to cancel"
And a reminder for our non-US users - it's not e+s+v. Just press Alt and see which button corresponds with which key.  
In Dutch version it's Alt+r+v which opens the menu to choose (Paste values only is 'w')
Or I can also press this little paper looking icon + V to do the same thing. Not sure what the button is actually called. http://imgur.com/7Awhn8z
This is what I've always used also.
Faster still, put this in your personal workbook and assign it to a key stroke (I use ctrl+shift+v)    

    Sub PasteSpecial_Values()
     
    Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues
    
    End Sub

Sorry I didn't watch the video, I use the  V so much I forgot it might not be people's default 
It might be easier but in a discussion of pro tips for efficiency, for almost all users it is far faster to invest in learning the keyboard short cuts and use them if you want speed.  Especially since the ribbon interface came out it walks you through learning the short cuts.


I used to take my new analysts mice away and make them learn how to do all the keyboard shortcuts and after a week or two they never thought of looking back.
You just blew my mind.

Thanks!
I originally used it in Office 2003 but works happily in 2013. I dont know about office 360.

In some ways yes and no.  "alt+e+s+v" is the old excel short cut that still works.  The prompted way is "alt+h+v+s".  I'd be curious if there is a similar duplication in the other language versions.
I think one of the other posters called it "menu".
The Ultra Pro Tip.
:-) I didn't know this combination. As a devoted keyboard user, I'm very disappointed in myself for not knowing this one.
To each his own. I use a ton of keyboard shortcuts (especially for filters), but for pasting I find right click+v way more convenient, especially considering I'm already using the mouse to select the cell I need to paste to. Instead of left clicking and hitting four buttons I right click and hit one. 
Yeah, I'm running Office 2010 and it still works, but it seems Excel prompts you to use their "new" keyboard shortcuts... Who knows!
It doesnt in excel 2016 :(
Hmmmmm thanks 
It is really about being all the way to get the benefit.  I agree if you are using the mouse or doing things in graphics it makes more sense to mouse it.
I didn't even know excel counted that high yet. I am always a version or two behind.
I've checked for you - it seems Excel's shortcuts differ in different languages. In Excel 2010 Alt-e opens the 'Data' tab. It's alt-r-v as well.
