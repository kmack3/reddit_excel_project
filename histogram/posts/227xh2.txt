The Excel team is doing an AMA right now!
Thanks for posting this! I would have completely missed it otherwise.
I'm disappointed that there are no plans to bring VBA to 21st century... Just the ability to collapse blocks of code would do wonders. I guess we'll have to wait till something like Office 2020 comes out
Have a look at [Excel-DNA](http://excel-dna.net) for making Excel add-ins (including high-performance UDFs) with VB.NET, C# or F#. It's all open-source, well-supported and you can use the free Visual Studio Express edition as your IDE.
(Only works on the real Excel client, though - not online, iPad or Mac...)
Very neat, I'll definitely take a look into that
