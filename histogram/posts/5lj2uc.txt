VBA to prevent cut/paste (but allow copy/paste) and VBA to prevent insert/delete of rows & columns
    Private Sub Worksheet_Activate()
        Select Case Application.CutCopyMode
            Case Is = xlCut
                Application.CutCopyMode = False
        End Select
    End Sub
    
    Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)
        Select Case Application.CutCopyMode
            Case Is = xlCut
                Application.CutCopyMode = False
        End Select
    End Sub

Put in each worksheet's code which you want to disable it in.

Awesome, that works perfectly for preventing the cut/paste option. Do you have anything that will stop users being able to insert or delete new rows/columns?
