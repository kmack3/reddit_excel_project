I dislike this dialog box.
I used to work on a lot of excel files that were simply whatever a client's accounting system vomited out.  Those were frequently the nastiest spreadsheets you ever saw, and they often had no or useless headers.
The one I hate is the 

The formula you typed contains an error.

No Shit, just let the cell show #NA or #VALUE and let me fix it myself. don't annoy the f out of me w/ popups.
Probably useful for frequent CSV users?
I spend a lot of time in Excel. I have to make it a bit fun. 
I hate that it always defaults to sort from smallest to largest. I rarely do that. 
Love the image.
There are many, many reasons a person might want to uncheck that box. What if I only want to sort the last 20 or so rows of a 1,000 row spreadsheet? What if I got crazy fucked up data from somewhere with no headers? It doesn't make me a barbarian.
I have to manipulate CSV data that not only has no headers, but there's no documentation that explains the significance of each column!  I'm not about to slap on meaningless headers like "Column N" for over 200 columns, thanks very much.
I hate when I forget to check that box and my headers get sorted.... grrrrrrrr.  Even when I import .csv, I need headers! Maybe it should be "my data does not have headers" instead! So there.
I like that idea! 
Nah those are cool because it highlights the errors with the cursor when you click "No let me fix it"
That's why I got started developing KeyRocket. KeyRocket shall pick up on your pattern (you always select that checkbox) and offer you to make that the default when the dialog shows up. We are not there yet, but getting closer :-)
Plebeian! Halfwit! You sir are naught but uncouth rabble!  
Remove yourself from my presence.
I'm not talking about the "No, let me fix it one"

I'm talking about the one where you get two options

[Ok] [Help]

and the help just brings up Excel help....
Even that one highlights the section it thinks is wrong though.
