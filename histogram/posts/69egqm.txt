Vlookup with 2 criteria?
    =INDEX(B:B,MATCH(D1&C3,J:J&K:K,0))
    entered with Control-Shift-Enter

Can you post a screenshot of what you're looking at, please?
comment saving for the future. Didn't know this was possible!

Need help with VLOOKUP()?

I am a bot.  This is the first function in my library; feel free to reply with function requests.
Go index and match. Forget about vlookup.
WT-ACTUAL-F

I've been doing it a whole lot more complicated.

    =INDEX(......,MATCH(1,(J:J=D1)*(K:K=C3),0))

Your way is so much easier
Will this also work with 3 criteria if you just add another &?
    Solution verified
thanks!
    
=INDEX(Sheet3!B8:$B$3465,MATCH($D$1&C8,Sheet3!$J$3:$J$3465&Sheet3!$K$3:$K$3465,0))
Note : I have done it this way a lot and this has the tendency to get a bit slow when working with a large amount of data. 
Oh. my. god.
This changes everything.
It is so simple!
can you explain how this being an array works?
If you know your data, then solarpool's way will work fine.  But you may want to worry about concatenating values to make a match where there shouldn't be one.

If d1="aaaa" and c3="bbbb", then solarpool's formula won't distinguish if J:k contain (aaaabb&bb) or (aa&aabbbb) or any other combination of strings that concatenate to aaaabbbb.



omg I thought I knew everything about Index-Match Array Formulas too!
yep

You have awarded one point to _solarpool_.    
[^Find ^out ^more ^here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/wiki/clippy)

did you use Control-Shift-Enter?  When editing the cell, you need to press all three of those buttons for the formula to work properly.
Once it get into the larger data sets I prefer PowerQuery's merge query :) but conceptually it's intuitive
Beyond [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/69egqm/comment/dh671ru)?
ps.  If you're worried about that concatenation, then you could add a unique character to solarpool's suggestion:

=INDEX(B:B,MATCH(D1&C3,J:J&K:K,0))

becomes

=INDEX(B:B,MATCH(D1&"|"&C3,J:J&"|"&K:K,0))

(still control shift enter)

(Use a character that wouldn't appear in those fields.)
Mother of Christ. This is beautiful 
yes
What's control-shift-enter do in excel? Never used that combination to get a formula to work.
Yeah, I feel like PowerQuery could be useful, I usually just do all my SQL first then do a data dump into excel, do you know if PowerQuery has a Mac version?
It makes a normal formula into an array formula. 

This formula uses the concatenate function (i.e. the & function) to attach stuff together - so if D1=A and C8=B then D1&C8 = AB. 

I then want to do the same thing with the lookup ranges - but the & function is only designed to be applied to one cell at a time as above. When I do J:J&K:K, without the array operator (CSE), Excel doesn't know how to parse this since you can't attach two ranges using the concatenate function. However, with CSE, I'm telling Excel that I want J1&K1, J2&K2, J3&K3 etc for all the cells in J:J and K:K. 
It creates an array formula. You don't need to use it that often, but an index-match formula requires it
PQ unfortunately does not have a Mac version
>~~an~~ **some** index-match formula requires it

index-match doesn't always need it - the basic function doesn't require it at all. It's the concatenate function that requires it. 


Ah, good to know
