[PROTIP] Customizing my quick access toolbar has saved me just as much time as the best formulas. If yours still only has the default Save/Save As/Undo, you should look at what else you can put there.

If you do this, don't forget to [export your customizations](http://www.addictivetips.com/microsoft-office/exportimport-ribbon-quick-access-toolbar-settings-office-2010/), because when you/someone else upgrades your OS or hardware or whatever, you're going to lose all of these sweet settings changes you have been depending on.
Definitely going to add unfilter! Why didn't I think of that?!
One of the easiest quickest ways to increase efficiency! Don't forget about alt command short cuts as well. 

Here is a really good blog post on several different qat setups.

I created my own tab, with all the most common items I use.

Alt+ shortcuts! :)
Select Current Region; Select Visible Cells; Format painter.
Added paste values on my computer at work running 2007 I think. Also added some often used repetitive macro buttons. Too many macros to remember the keyboard shortcuts.  My 2013 version of excel at home has paste values functionality on the right click menu, which is nice. It's difficult going back and forth though. Work from home Thursday and Friday and go to the office Mon through Wed.  
Format painter, Comma Number Format, Increase decimal, Decrease Decimal, Autofilter (filtering by selection).
I use the file path on my quick access toolbar, let's me know where the file is
Set Print Area, this one is huge for me
Several people have had the exact same reaction when I've shown them this in person
Thanks for this! I've wasted so much time setting up a new computer with the settings I prefer...
Keyboard shortcuts > qat IMO. I use both, but hate to take my hands off the keyboard when I don't have to. This info graphic has taught me a lot.

I made a custom tab originally but for some reason didn't get in the habit of using it. Your setup looks good though. I think I just prefer how compact the quick access toolbar is
Select Current Region is the only I've never tried. Pretty cool, it's like a ctrl-shift-L multi attack! And it has it's own icon, which for me honestly is a required criteria 
I always just go to file>recent workbooks
I actually hate the 2 step process it takes to find the files location- 1) go to Save, 2) realize I need to go to Save as to see it pop up. I will try out this recommendation
