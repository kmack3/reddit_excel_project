My Excel sheet for randomly generating almost everything a DM needs to run a town (NPCs, shop names, store inventories, prices, etc.) (x-post DnDBehindTheScreen)
Some cool stuff. I see a few places where you could maybe optimize the formulas. One tiny error/issue. The way the items are pulled, the last item on list has a VERY small chance of appearing, because the random number generator basically rounds down. So, with jeweler, it picks a number from 1 -18000, but if randbetween gives 17999, you get the 17900 item. Might be worth adding a dummy item at end, or we could change this...
One issue I see with this file is that all the formulas will calc/give new values anytime you open it. So, let's say you've got your list of people/places/etc for a town and you stop gaming for the night. Next week you open the file when resuming the game and all the formulas auto-update -- all your names, places, items will change.

If you convert the file to a macro-enable workbook you have the ability to turn off auto-calculation for just that one file on-open in the VBA editor.

    Private Sub Workbook_Open()
        Application.Calculation = xlCalculationManual
    End Sub

Also remember to add this to re-enable auto-calculation when you close the file.

    Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
        Application.Calculation = xlCalculationAutomatic
    End Sub

The obvious pitfall of this is that any other Excel file you open at the same time as this one will also have auto-calc disabled, since it's an application function. 
I want to be very clear this is not my OC. This was created by /u/Laetha [+3] and posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/5vjwe9/my_excel_sheet_for_randomly_generating_almost/). I thought some /r/Excel users might enjoy the project, and others might be able to offer suggestions for improvement for individual users who might want to tweak the output.
For the better item calculation, here's what you could change Enchanter formula to (others use similar structure)

=LOOKUP(RANDBETWEEN(1,MAX(Enchanter!$A:$A)+LOOKUP(9E+99,Enchanter!$B:$B)),Enchanter!$A:$A)

The MAX and LOOKUP functions should run a little faster. It now quickly grabs the biggest number and last number from col B (the rarity) to determine which numbers to calculate.

Then why did you title it "my Excel sheet"?
Great contribution, exactly what I a was looking for. Thanks! Going to try awarding you a clippy point even though this is flared "Discussion"...

He just copied the exact title from the other thread. Post looks to be a carbon copy for the most part, 
That is normal x-post etiquette. The ambiguity of the title is why I posted a disclaimer both in the comments and at the very top of the post as well, to ensure its not missed.

You have awarded one point to _CFAman_.

That explains it. The title is so long, I stopped reading before I got to the x-post part.
