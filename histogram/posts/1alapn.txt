I'm looking for free excel exercises to sharpen my skills (sort/filter, pivot tables, sumifs, vlookup, sumproduct formulas)
If you are looking for something quick and easy, I just recently built a site called [OfficeScholar](http://officescholar.com), which is aimed at getting people up to speed with Excel.  All of the screencast tutorials come with a free sample Excel file to follow along and practice the concepts.  

Right now it has a paywall, which I plan on removing soon - you (and everyone here) can use a voucher code "free228" to watch all of the content for free.  If you feel like paying, it is only $4.99.

This site is very much in beta - so go easy on me!  My background is in investment banking, but I have been coding (Ruby on Rails) for the last several months, so this is one of my first web projects.

A big update will be coming soon with the ability to submit actual Excel workbooks as quizzes and collect real feedback (and a certificate if you pass the skill assessments).

Hope it helps and good luck!

It's a blog by journalist Abbot Katz. He grabs real life data sets and walks through, step by step, how he slices and dices them with Excel. This gives you the advantage of working with the messiness of real world situations and what you can do about it.

There are some good pivot table exercises in these two posts:

Here are some I've created as tutorials for friends or redditors...

Also, I agree with JungleJme that Chandoo is a great site for getting awesome files to play around with.
I use this to brush up on things.

If you have a public library near you, check out some of those excel for dummies books, or Excel bible books. They usually comes with a CD that contain exercises that are helpful. 

If you've already got things you're doing, it's also helpful to go one step further in what you're doing. Are you making a workout schedule? Can you do the entire thing without a mouse? Are you a March Madness fan? Can you get a data-pull from a stat source to get live refreshable data? Just think of a project and do it.
I enhanced my excel skills by keeping track of my finances. Most banks and mint.com allow you to download your data to excel or at least csv. It's your own data. You'll learn about yourself, learn about excel, and probably handle your finances better.
Of the links on the right handside then go back to Chandoo.Org and sign up for the newsletter/blog

You'll get excellent walkthroughs of various concepts, usually born out of questions asked by subscribers and each walkthrough usually comes with an excel file that you can use in conjuction with the walkthrough to understand the concepts.

You'll also get asked to do "homework" - where he'll ask you to work on a concept or question and it will feature in the next blog. You can really get involved with the community if you wish. 

As someone who started as a beginner in excel this blog is an absolute must! Plus, i've not done it, but he runs online excel courses that look relatively inexpensive to me and could be of use.
whens ur interview, and for what job
Awesome, thanks so much for that.  If I end up getting this job, I'll finally have money and will definitely pay the $4.99 as a small token of my appreciation!
My office forbids Chrome Addons so I can't save with RES.  I am very interested in this.  Kudos.
Wow, this is really great. It didn't ask me to pay though, so I'm guessing you removed it. Honestly I can't thank you enough. So much better to have actual tables to practice with than just watching a video. 
Good advice, thanks.  Only problem is that my interview is on Thursday, so the newsletter might not be enough help in time!  I guess that's what I get for always doing things last minute...
Interview is this Thursday for a Financial Analyst position
Glad to hear you enjoyed it! If you visit the site again and have a moment to spare, please leave feedback or a comment!  http://www.officescholar.com/

EDIT: Also, let me know if there are any topics you'd like covered!
Well, if you go to the blog directly, all the old content is there and there are some handy bits to work through.

http://chandoo.org/wp/2009/08/19/excel-pivot-tables-tutorial/

Notice that halfway down the page there is a link to "Download the tutorial workbook" - you can then work with the workbook and the website in conjunction with one another.

Some lookup explanations

http://chandoo.org/wp/2008/11/19/vlookup-match-and-offset-explained-in-plain-english-spreadcheats/

Also, if you like VLOOKUP you will LOVE INDEX/MATCH, again with example workbook.

http://chandoo.org/wp/2010/11/02/how-to-lookup-values-to-left/

SUMPRODUCT is the Grand Daddy of SUMIF and mastering it ESPECIALLY important if the organisation is still on Excel 2003...as SUMIFS and COUNTIFS do not work in 2003.

If you get your head round these concepts you'll be a shoe in! 
Good luck today, hope you nail it! 
I'm pretty sure I did well!  Can't thank you enough for those links you gave me!  

Although it seems that at that job I'd have a lot less time to browse Reddit :/  Oh well
Great news, let us know if you get it - there's always time for Reddit - I've always got a browser minimised with Reddit, chandoo and excel help forum loaded - if anyone asks I say I'm crowd sourcing a solution to a bug in my development!!
That's a pretty smart idea, definitely stealing it.  

>Boss: "What the hell is this Reddit.com you're always on?"

>Me: "It's this great crowd-sourced Excel help website, definitely has improved my productivity."

>Boss: "Very good, carry on"

I'll definitely let r/excel know when I hear back.
