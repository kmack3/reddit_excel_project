Holding ctl lets you select a cell multiple times. Why?
I've always wondered this, too. [Here's an explanation](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2769340) from Microsoft that really doesn't say *why* other than a graphics change.
Does anybody know how to deselect a selected cell while still maintaining the rest of the selection?
You can use this to see the sum of various cells that aren't adjacent in the bottom right of the worksheet, the same way you would if you just highlighted a section of a column.

It's handy to get some quick figures sometimes without resorting to filters, formulas, etc.
I like the workaround they mentioned : It essentially says stop what you're doing and start again. :D
Hmm, the KB pretty much states that it's a known bug without actually calling it a bug. 

It's kind of a funny bug if you ask me, but can definitly become annoying if you're trying to deselect an individual cell...
"This change enables you to highlight overlapping selections."

There you go.  Not a great reason, but a reason!
I also find the inability to deselect very infuriating.  That said, if you find yourself manually selecting disconnected cells a lot, you can probably find a smarter way to do what you're doing.
this has been infuriating for me as well.  i think you just have to start over.
