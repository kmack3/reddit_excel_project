Is there a website for hosting Excel spreadsheets?
What about putting your examples into a OneDrive / Google Drive / DropBox folder and sharing it from there?

[Excel Online](https://office.live.com/start/Excel.aspx) is Microsoft's official site. I'd use that. It's the best viewer outside of viewing the file locally, as you can use Pivot Tables/Charts, dashboards, filters, dropdowns, etc, all with the native look and feel.
