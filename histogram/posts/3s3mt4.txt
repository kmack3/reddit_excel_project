How to run SQL queries on Excel Data ?
[This blog post](http://chandoo.org/wp/2012/04/02/using-excel-as-your-database/) explains it pretty well.
Give the Data ranges [Names](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Define-and-use-names-in-formulas-4d0f13ac-53b7-422e-afd2-abd7ff379c64), then connect to them with MSACCESS using External Data > Excel.
Then you can query them as normal data in Access.




[Power Query](https://www.google.com/search?q=powerquery&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8) might help? 
Setting this as a discussion so we can get as much input as possible - this should be a great tool!
Have you looked at thingiequery.com? The developer who built it advertised it in here a while ago. Its very good!
Here's a template that I use, I've tweaked to sort of what you need.
There are two sheets; Sheet1 and Sheet2 all the fields headings are in row 1.
I return all of Sheet1 using the * in the SQL query and all the values from the field "F6" in Sheet2. I join the two sheets where the values in "F1" are equal between the datasets.

    Sub Query()
        'Define Variables
        Dim cnn1 As Object
        Dim rst1 As Object
        Dim sql As String
        Dim wsht As Worksheet
        Dim UseAutoClear As Boolean
        Dim x As Long
        Dim y As Long
        Dim HeadRng As Range
        Dim ManClearRange As Range
        Dim WBpath As String
        
        On Error GoTo Query_Error_Handler:
        
        ' Set the variables
        WBpath = "C:\Book2.xlsx"
        Set wsht = Worksheets(ActiveSheet.Name)
        Set HeadRng = wsht.Range("k11")
        
        ' Clear old data options
        UseAutoClear = True ' Autoclear assumes that the first column of data is continuous and has no gaps
        'else
        x = 3 ' number of rows to clear (if x = 0 then you have to set ManClearRange)
        y = 10 ' number of columns to clear
        'else
        Set ManClearRange = wsht.Range("A1:z65550")
        
        ' Open a connection
        Set cnn1 = VBA.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
        cnn1.ConnectionString = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=" & WBpath & ";Extended Properties=""Excel 12.0 Macro;HDR=YES"";"
        cnn1.Open
        
        '*************************************************************************************
        'Can run multipile queries here with out closing the connection. You may have to move the Clear statement and reassign headrng
        
        ' Open new Recordset for data
        Set rst1 = VBA.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset")
        rst1.ActiveConnection = cnn1
        
        ' Set up the SQL
        sql = ""
        sql = sql & "Select s1.*, s2.F6 " & vbNewLine
        sql = sql & "FROM [Sheet1$] s1," & vbNewLine
        sql = sql & "[Sheet2$] s2" & vbNewLine
        sql = sql & "Where s1.F1 = s2.F1 " & vbNewLine
        
        ' run the query
        rst1.Open sql
        
        ' Clear the old Data from the excel sheet
        If UseAutoClear = True Then
            AutoRange(HeadRng).Clear
            ElseIf x > 0 Then
            HeadRng.Resize(x, y).Clear
        Else
            ManClearRange.Clear
        End If
        
        ' export Record set
        HeadRng.Offset(1, 0).CopyFromRecordset rst1
        
        ' export fields
        For x = 0 To rst1.Fields.Count - 1
            HeadRng.Offset(, x) = rst1.Fields(x).Name
        Next
        
        ' Clear Recordset
        rst1.Close
        Set rst1 = Nothing
        
        '*********************************************************************************
        
        ' Close Connection
        cnn1.Close
        
        Exit Sub
        
        ' Error Capture display the error
    Query_Error_Handler:
        MsgBox "Error #" & Err.Number & ": " & Err.Description & vbCrLf
        Debug.Print "Error #" & Err.Number & ": " & Err.Description & vbCrLf
        
    End Sub
    Public Function AutoRange(startCell As Range) As Range
        Dim x As Long
        Dim y As Long
        Dim rg As Range
        
        x = 1
        y = 1
        
        Do While startCell.Offset(x, 0).Value <> ""
            x = x + 1
        Loop
        Do While startCell.Offset(0, y).Value <> ""
            y = y + 1
        Loop
        
        Set rg = startCell.Resize(x, y)
        Set AutoRange = rg
    End Function

Hope it helps.
>I want to run queries (SQL join Query) on these two data sheets, is there any add in or way to do that ?

Access
Fuck Chandoo is a baws!
hi, any more blog to understand it better ? this blog seems to confuse a noob like me :-(
I opened up the example file and I cannot run any queries. Has anyone else had this issue?
thanks, will run this code and revert back. PS :Due to Indian Christmas, i might not find time to run the code in next 3-4 days and hence will delay updating the status to Solved in the  Sub, apologies in advance.
I would suggest reading through this :
