Best Excel Training Sites/ Materials?
Take a look at [Excel-Easy](http://www.excel-easy.com/).  They start off really simple and slowly move up the difficulty.  Then once you finished everything, there is a section called 300 examples that looks back at everything you learned in more depth.  
I learned most of what I know from

You will find a ton of solutions, tricks from this guy.   
Also just jump in to it and if you can't solve something look up your questions in google.   
  
Forums, such as   
  
[mrexcel](http://www.mrexcel.com/forum/forum.php)  
[chandoo's blog](http://chandoo.org/wp/)   
[datapig technologies/bacon bits](http://www.datapigtechnologies.com/blog/) is another great blog with lots of answers.  
  
Some of the forums are require you to register, but it's worth gold if you want to progress your career.  
Also you can find us here on reddit, I haven't seen many questions that remained unanswered.  
Best of luck, and if you need help just give us a shout!

Search for the word repository on this sub. We have an entire thread dedicated to advice. 
Is there any interactive training software or website?
Need.

This is the best teacher. When you need to achieve something... Google it. You'll then start to pick up new ideas of what's possible and aim for that. It snowballs pretty quickly. If you just go into a training site without an actual need you'll end up feeling like Paris Hilton reading the complete works of Shakespeare

I've really enjoyed excel exposure (linked on the sidebar). It is not too geared toward those with no real excel experience, but still goes over the basics of various topics before getting a bit more complex. As a plus, you can download the videos individually from Vimeo to watch them (you must actually do so from Vimeo and not the embedded examples), if you are inclined to watch them on your phone (I just added them to Dropbox). 
If you want to learn Microsoft Excel, there are several places on the net that offer online courses. The one I personally like is http://www.onlinecourses.train.... They have videos and pdf course packs like most online course. But they also have lots of assignments you can use to practice the concepts. There are simulated exercises also which are basically guided practice sessions and very helpful.

a "Code Academy" for Excel? I'd kill for that. 
Thanks, I have to post from my phone these days.
