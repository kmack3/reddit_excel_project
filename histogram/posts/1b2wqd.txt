Arena.xlsm an RPG created in Excel
Cool.  For saving though, you might want to look into XML.  You can set up a scheme and then assign it to a data table and then you can easily import and export to an XML file all the data in the data tables with just a button click.
O_O
I didn't make it I just found the link and wanted to share.  
For ranged attack, I select the cell with the enemy and then click the bow & arrow.
Absolutely fantastic. 
Just had a quick go. Excellent work!
Mindblowingly Awesome. Really  shows some of the crazy things people can do with excel if they put their mind to it. Bravo!
I get some weird errors while playing. In the first room, when I kill the creature in there, this is the first error that pops up:

After that, if I try to do anything, I get this error:

How do ranged attacks work?
I'll look into it, currently all of the game data is saved to a hidden spreadsheet tab so when you want to save/load the game it just pulls it from there with a macro.
Do you have a supported version of Excel? From the project page:  
>Arena.Xlsm has been tested to work on PC versions of Microsoft Excel including Excel 2007, and Excel 2010. It should also work on Excel 2013 although I have not been able to extensively test it. Arena.Xlsm will not work on Mac versions of Microsoft Excel.
Yeah, I kept clicking the button but I could never get mine to hit.
You need to select the cell with the enemy, then hit the ranged attack button. 
You're not the link submitter... you're the guy who made the game.

EDIT: he already did his AMA!
I'm using 2007. Must be some problem on my end.
oh my goodness. that's why.
There should be a fix for this coming out this weekend. See here for more information: http://carywalkin.wordpress.com/2013/03/27/arena-xlsm-version-1-1-preview/
