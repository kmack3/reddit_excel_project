Microsoft Global Excel Training Conference
I am so going to watch the live! I hope they're going to have a blast out there! I envy them!
I'm in London tomorrow but I'm in meetings and will be on the train home when this kicks off so won't be able stream... Bugger. Some earlier notice would have been nice. Oh well, next year 
I work in financial services in London and actually my company got me a slot to go to ModelOff but due to work, I was unable to make it. Really disappointed but hope it all goes well. 
Twitch does excel. That would be awsome.

Edit: or something like that.

Edit: spelling
So uh...these recorded? I have to sleep/work during these times :-(
This really interests me but I hope the video is much better this year than what I could see when watching [last years final event](https://vimeo.com/114151578).  I was envisioning seeing a combined/split screen of each of the finalists live as they worked the problem.  Something like [Devwars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePdWYb5o_3c) but obviously modified to suit ModelOff.   

Watching the event after edits I don't want to see all the attendees walking around the room huddled around people. I want to see the code as it happens.

Still going to tune in though, XD.

 
I think it actually started today. Probably something lost in translation with the time zones.
