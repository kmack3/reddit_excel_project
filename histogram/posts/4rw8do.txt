What is this called and how do I make this from within Excel?
It's called 'Grouping' :P

You can find it at the far right side of the Data tab in the ribbon.
Thanks! I never would have found it. Solution Verified!
The keyboard shortcut is Alt A G G. To collapse the cells that are now grouped, Alt A H. To expand, Alt A J.

Enjoy.
