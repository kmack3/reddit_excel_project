/r/excel Sourced - Template 2 - Skills Test
/u/MidevilPancake had a great post not too long ago with some tests for an Excel lunch-and-learn. Maybe he would like to submit them for this /r/Excel sourced.

I'm excited for this. Great idea epicmindwarp.
Do I submit it here or PM you the file?
Thanks for the template. It filled a little slot in my day when I should have been working. Quite a welcome distraction.

I'm quite sure that there is a much more elegant way of making the formulas, but I went crazy on the nested countif statements. 

One thing I cannot figure out, is how to count A* and A grades differently. The countif seems to read a A* as an A. Any tips for this??

Cheers
Is there any way we can be notified of this or will we just have to keep an eye on the sub?
Absolutely! I'd love to! I published those for a reason!

/u/epicmindwarp, consider this my offering of those files. 

EDIT: And thanks for the compliment!
Many thanks
Submit it here! 

So that way others can see, prevent duplication and can build on it. 
Can you submit or PM the file. I am preparing a test for a hire and would like to use this as a base.

Used my Google-fu to a great extent on the VBA tab.

Nice challenge and now my personal macro book has a few more commands in. 

Thanks for the effort in making this book. I'll keep my eyes open in the future for more.
What do you want to be notified of?
Most of the questions I'm including are fairly advanced. Would you prefer more basic questions to start off? 
Perfect, Thanks. 
Just when the full template is released
