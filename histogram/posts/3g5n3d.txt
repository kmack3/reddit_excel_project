Where can I find some interesting excel exercises to work on while I'm bored in the office?
Hey thanks for posting!

You've come to the right place! In fact, you can find great things to work on all from within this sub!

Check out these links:

If you notice, the last link is to the front page of this sub. Check out Solved threads to see how problems are solved! If you feel able, head on over to Unsolved and try helping others with their Excel issues! I know I get tons of practice and learn new ways to solve issues all the time while working in Unsolved.
I'd work on learning VBA, but won't deny that mastering the intermediates of excel helps in understanding how VBA will help. In certain jobs I've found that maybe 30-50% of people look at excel as complicated but can work through it, whereas 90-95% of people look at VBA and won't even try it. You'll be treated as "the smart guy" if you can do even some basic things with it. 

[This link](http://www.homeandlearn.org/) got me started and explains the basics pretty well and in detail.
I like trolling excel help forums.  Interesting exercises, plus helping people!
Go to project Euler and try to solve some of the problems
The best way to learn Excel and exercise your skills, in my opinion, is to give yourself a project to work on. This can be something work related or personal. 

Something work related could be a report that has to be processed and is redundant. 

Something personal could be a task manager, where you have to organize your daily/monthly tasks. For me my biggest personal project was a spreadsheet that acted as an accounting ledger. It first started as something labor intensive and tedious (idk if you know accounting at all but this consisted of writing my entries in the journal, then applying the debits and credits to each asset and expense account; then on month end I would close each expense  account and populate the income statement - all manually). Then I looked for inefficiencies so as to make it more automated. First I started writing formulas; e.g. I made dashboards. 

Then I would record macros (such as for the closing). Here is where I was introduced to what the programming language VB looks like. Although recording macros is more efficient than manual work, the code itself is very inefficient. And there are things you can do with VBA that you just can't do by recording. So I looked for ways to make it more efficient. 

This being said, my biggest go to website is [StackOverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com). Here is where I learned a lot of VB. With stackoverflow, I was able to learn how to automate everything in my accounting spreadsheet; the closing, and the debits and credits that are applied to each account from the journal. All of the macros are written, i.e. nothing recorded. With your own project, you'll encounter many problems/errors and areas where there's room for improvement. You'll be driven to find the solutions to your problems, and the whole process of correcting/debugging is a great exercise.

[Mr. Excel](http://www.mrexcel.com/) 

and if you want to learn some programming languages you can go to [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Some of these languages can be a good foundation for understanding VB. 

Edit: wording & additional sentence 
VBA is nice to have, but if you're wanting to learn new stuff for analysis etc then take a look at the Power BI suite (Power Query, Power View, Power Map and Power Pivot)

Ah, I did not see there was an unsolved category...
Thanks for the post
This. I shunned VBA for so long not knowing its true potential. Finally taught myself an intermediate level and its great. So useful.
I love project Euler. (And it just came back [online](https://projecteuler.net/news) yesterday!)

How do you define 'intermediate'? I want to see how I compare with others outside of my office.
I have no problem with writing VBA for excel features and so on, but I've seen some SQL query import code that baffles me. I'd say ive spent maybe 40 hours learning, and another 100 or so writing my own code.
What sort of code do you build?
Depends really. Mostly data conditioning stuff (the data my work collects isn't very user friendly) but I also do a lot of time saving code for colleagues reports.
web scraping?
I've never had to but I understand the theory. 

A lot of what I do is making relatively basic things fool proof for colleagues that don't understand excel, or making daily tasks easier for myself. 
I always send out emails without the attachment so could be as simple as a bit of code that sets up a mass email and attaches the report. Saves me a lot of repeated embarrassment daily.
