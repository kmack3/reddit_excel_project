I wrote up some Excel Challenges today, if you'd like to sharpen your skills and or provide feedback. Post in the comments if you need help!
If you finished these and need another challenge, [here's another](http://1drv.ms/1mw6buA) I made a couple years ago. Not for the faint of heart.
Ok, this might be a stupid question: what is "Major String Value?" I known how to do a vlookup, but I don't know how to use it to find a Major String Value. Is this some hidden gem of excel or am I missing something obvious because it is so far past the time normal people sleep?
>Don't worry too much about the range_lookup (the fourth, last, and optional argument) for this kind of VLOOKUP.

Umm, what? Definitely worry about the last argument, as it defaults to TRUE. Otherwise you'll have things like "POST" returning "Performance" as the major name (i.e. approximate match instead of exact match)
Dr. Kelso would approve.
Thanks! Are the solutions somewhere handy?
Follow-up challlenge: 

Solve it without using any helper columns 
That was fun. Here is what I came up with. I used 3 helper columns. I wouldn't call this elegant, but it works. I'm going to go check out your solution now.

Sorry, no, that is Berklee talk. The "Major String Value" is just like "Performance" instead of "PERF". If you look in the second tab of 'Sample Data.xlsx', I listed them for you.
Thanks, fixed.
"You think my name is Turk Turkelton?"

"And MRS. TURKELTON!"
Yeah, but you have to make them yourself 
A bit like mine, the solution *data* is provided (in /u/dipique's challenge it's in the second tab; in mine there's a sample at the bottom of the README) but the solutions code is not provided.
I'm working from my phone, but I think this version has the (a) solution.

Very nice! :)
I hadn't even noticed the second tab. Thanks for the clarification. I guess the root problem was me trying to do these at 3:30 AM.

Edit: Just finished it. Nice to practice with excel since I need the skills if I want a job. Thanks for the challenge!
Great job!
Question on your other challenge: are the lists internally nonrepeating? Like, is column 2 made of nonrepeating numbers within itself?
