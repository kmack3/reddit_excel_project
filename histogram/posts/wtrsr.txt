Every time someone asks me for help with something "really complicated" at work...
Why you no INDEX(MATCH())???  
Also the answer to all complicated things to excel is INDIRECT and R1C1. :)
I've had managers that would ask me to do complicated stuff, then complain about how complicated it was.  I'm glad you are recognized for your efforts.

Agreed.  I recently learned both VLOOKUP and Index-Match and found an interesting article.

Haha, it just doesn't have the same ring to it...  Also, I find Vlookup is easier to explain!
That's my favorite.
I've told my boss that if *she* thinks it is easy, to budget at least a day. If she thinks it'll take days, budget about half an hour. :)
I like this approach!
