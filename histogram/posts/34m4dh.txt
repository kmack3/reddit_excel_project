/r/excel is now recruiting
There are far too many people better than me on this sub. Frankly, I'm in awe at some of the solutions.
Done.
Just applied! Been hoping for an opportunity to get involved as more than a contributor! Thanks for opening this up to the community!
Luckily excel skill or knowledge is not taken into account for this role.  We are simply looking for active  members of the community that can help us keep up with the flair.

With out last mod post, that seemed to be one of the largest issues that we needed to address and here we are today.  Every submission will be considered.
