How to rank items against themselves?
You need a number that says how much you like it - showing A1:B6

How much U like it | Rank | 
:--- | :--- | 
1 | 3 | 
3 | 1 | 
2.3333338 | 2 | 
0.0000125 | 4 | 
-4 | 5 | 

With B2 `=RANK(A2,A:A)` filled down. Just add numbers to the first column and fill the formula further down.
that's what I figured I had to do. thanks for the help
