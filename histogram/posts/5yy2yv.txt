How can I have the numbers of hours left in a Cell ( more than 24) ?
You can treat date-time with normal sums as Excel uses a decimal data-time datatype.

To get the total hours, simply minus one date from the other , format the cell with custom format `[hh]:mm` . The square brackets force total hours shown without converting the hours to days.
