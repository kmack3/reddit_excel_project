How to disable opening multiple worksheets in one instance of excel in excel 2010
I'm pretty sure you have to edit the registry - [see here](https://dottech.org/26491/how-to-force-microsoft-excel-to-open-files-in-new-window-how-to-guide/). 

As a note - editing the registry can have catastrophic and irreversible results if done incorrectly. 

I haven't had excel 2010 in a while, but when I had it - I used the registry edit option. I did find [his option](https://superuser.com/questions/21602/open-excel-files-in-new-window) with a quick google but have never tried it.
