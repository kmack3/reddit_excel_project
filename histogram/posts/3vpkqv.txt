Help for my mom
Shame in private; praise in public.

Why don't people understand this? 
I picked up most of what I know from *Learn Excel 20xx with the Smart Method* books, but a lot of the video tutorials are free [here](http://thesmartmethod.com) to get her started. The lessons are really quick and  easy and they have an Essential Skills section for beginners and an Expert Skills section, too.

I dabble a bit, what type of revenge you got in mind?

For learning,  office 2010 is common in biz enviorments.  Has excel, access, word, powerpoint, etc...

Just to look good, have her research pivot tables, conditional formatting and graphs.  That'll let you polish a turd.

To *actually* learn,  experience is key but learning functions and macros will kick start her.  Techonthenet.com is good for that stuff
Flair changed to discussion. Let's keep the sub tidy. 

I'll point out our learning mega thread!

The Youtube Channel ExcelIsFun is how I learned almost everything I know. Downloadable worksheets and an amazing teacher. 
for charting, have her check out this website here:;

It is, by far, one of the best charting resources, with clear data examples of how to set up things. 

depends on if your mom is a reader or a watcher :P 

For business settings, things like waterfall charts are always very nice, also bullet charts. Even if she hadn't had this thing with her boss-man, she should check them out! Bullet charts are great for sales, for showing things like "target, current, projected sales" all in one bar. Waterfalls are awesome at showing things like movements in sales volumes year-on-year,

www.ed2go.com has great Excel courses. If you pass the online final, you get a cert that says you have 24 hrs of training. 
Keyboard shortcuts. Get comfortable with them and don't touch the mouse or menus. Then, when you look like you're playing the keyboard like a piano, people will think you're a wizard. Keyboard shortcuts are the fastest way to look impressive. Of course, actually knowing about the program is great too but will take more time. 
something-something jerk store...
I myself am not very savvy with excel. What version would commonly be used in a sales setting? Also thanks so much for the help!
Thanks friend!
Just something cool she could use to chart sales and make him look dumb. She out did everyone in the Midwest and he yelled at her in front of everyone for not filling in an excel document correctly.
Sounds good. Thanks!
Well I thought about googleing it, but that goes to the highest bid with SEO and what not. Figured you guys would know better!
Thanks very much!
The Excel version is irrelevant since they are mostly the same, but have her look at the videos based on whichever version her office is running. She can skip videos on topics she's already familiar with, and just focus on learning the new-to-her stuff.
Pivot tables,  suggested graphs, and slicers: Google and learn

Will take raw data (crap) and can make it look like slick shit
Great thanks a lot!
I have no idea what those mean but I'll pass it along. Thank you!

Edit: googled it. Them graphs tho!
Anytime

You should look into excel and access,  will help you land big money jobs
Browsing this subreddit I'm kinda thinking the same. I don't have Microsoft suite on my mac but it's at the end of its life about. Going pc next. I've heard good things about some of the surface laptops.
