I created an entire game in Excel. Here is the unprotected code for you to learn from it!
Sometimes I think I'm getting pretty good at Excel. 

Nope.

Fascinating work man!
Kudos on the hard work! I've found that having an end goal of what you want to do with a programming language contributes to picking it up fairly quickly.
That's insane!  
Downloading and playing for a bit later.  
  
Screenshot URL doesn't work for me though.
Awesome work! What resources did you use to learn VBA? 
You should consider posting this to /r/somethingimade as well!
Cool

I was thinking about creating hearthstone as a learning tool.  
That's very impressive!  How much coding experience did you have going in?
Wow, I love Xcom now I can play it in excel!
I'm not going to play this... Probably gonna miss a 99% shot in front of the sectoid! 


JK this is awesome!
Wtf? I didn't think excel vba was so powerful. Kudos man this is insane
This is outstanding
Your suggestions for being a VBA God ?
I am newbie here...

It definitely does. I found the lack of problems to practice on the biggest hurdle when learning vba; there just aren't as many good problems outside of work that are really engaging. That's why I worked on this instead :)
Thanks, fixed it :)
Most of the time just google and the msdn reference for more specific questions. I learned the initial stuff from YourProgrammingNetwork on Youtube, which I can really recommend!
For me it's not about resources. I'm writing some code, then I realise I don't know how to do something, so I google it. I imagine the majority of people here are the same. Sure I know professional developers who aren't far from that.
Having a goal, that's what it's about.
Good suggestion, I just did. I'm not really marketing it, but that seems like a good subreddit to share the awesomeness that is a game in Excel :)
When I first started this I had just learned vba (which is my first programming language). Basically I knew If-Then, For-To-Loops, and writing numbers into cells, but that's it. Everything else I learned while making the game. One of the key components, storing classes in public vars, I actually got from this sub.
I was debating if you miss a >95% shot to have a msgbox pop up saying "That's XCOM baby!"
Thanks :) VBA can do pretty much everything other languages can, it's just really bad at displaying the results and being fast. But luckily for a project like this neither is that important, so it may look more impressive than it really is.
Practise! Just choose a project you like working on. Once you spend time with it, you're going to improve naturally.
Haven't had a chance to download or play, but I will asap. As someone who spends most of their day using Excel (and, when I'm lucky, using vba to wrestle difficult problems) I'm already immensely impressed with your efforts. Great job.
Exactly how I learnt. Probably not the best though as I just wing it most of the time. i.e. still not sure about all thing Dims e.g. "Long" "String" etc. Whereas a lot of people on the help forums know all about them.
This is in my opinion the best excel and VBA resource in existence.
