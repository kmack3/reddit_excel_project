Is there a keyboard substitute for a mouse left click?
If you're talking about when have filtered columns, you can access the filter menu with ALT + DOWN ARROW, navigate this menu with UP/DOWN ARROWS and check/uncheck things with SPACE BAR
Have you tried the `F2` key to edit a cell's contents?
F2

It works in Windows too if you want to edit a filename in Explorer.
>If I wanted to make a change to text within a cell,

You can make a lot of changes to the text by using Alt-H-<something>

make it larger? Alt-H-FG
change cell color? Alt-H-H
Change text color? Alt-H-FC

you can pretty much see all your options on the ribbon as soon as you just start the Alt-H part.
