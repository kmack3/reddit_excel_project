How to use INDEX and MATCH to include a 3rd parameter?
    {=INDEX($D$2:$D$51,MATCH(G3&H3&I3,$A$2:$A$51&$B$2:$B$51&$C$2:$C$51,0))}

Hit Ctrl+Shift+Enter to get the {} around the formula to make it an array formula. 


Something to the effect of =index(range you're returning values from, match(car type&criteria2&criteria3, car type range& criteria2 range& criteria 3 range,0))

Ctrl + shift + enter
Thank you very much!
