Listening to it now. Pressing Alt E + S + V to paste as values? I like Menu key+  down + down+  right. Less hand movement and no holding alt down.
Don't have to hold alt, just a tap then e, then s, then v.
Oh. Well, even then the arrow keys make for better grouping, and uses my dominant hand. But theoretically you could memorize a number of alt methods, which is really cool.
alt e s f for pasting formulas. Super easy.
