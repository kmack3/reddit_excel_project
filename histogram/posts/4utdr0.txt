Contract in excel
You could also use a MS Word mail merge
That is very easy using &. How I would do it:

1. Create an input sheet which has the parts of the text that change. One cell for each input. [You can name the ranges like CLIENTCOMPANYNAME etc to make the formula easier to read]

2. Create a fixed tab which has the standard contract - each time you have a member that needs to change stop the text and start the next section in a new cell. This is important. 

3. Using the & function you can simply use cells references between the tabs to build the full sentence which is dynamic based on the inputs on your input sheet. i.e. =Fixed!A1&Input!A1&Fixed!B2&Input!B2


If you are using named ranges then if could look like =StandardOpening&CompanyName&....

Fiddle around with the & operator and you'll see how easy it is.

Your only issue would then be formatting the text, it might just be easier to keep in word and use the Replace Function (ctrl+H)...

Thank you. Will try it out. If I can properly format it as well it could be answer to my problem. I was looking at the Mail Merge as well. It is just the fact that when I calculate a price I have all of the variables so it would be really convenient if all the info would automatically fill in the contract.
It works great but I'm having problem formatting the text. Is there any way you can do it as well as in Word?
Will try that. Thanks!
Not as good as in Word. In Formulas for example, you can't format letters differently.
