Does anyone use their Excel skills for volunteering?
This reminded me of Toyota donating efficiency instead of money to a charity. Here's the story: [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/nyregion/in-lieu-of-money-toyota-donates-efficiency-to-new-york-charity.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)

It's a great story and I like the idea of doing it on an individual level with Excel.
So weird that I've also had this idea... I keep thinking that an hour of my time helping do whatever they need in Excel would be far more valuable than whatever else I could offer. 

I assist at my sports club by analysing their info to make better financial decisions. Not saving the world but at least it's helping out a non-profit. 

What are you thinking of doing?
Occasionally I get to help out a non-profit with my Excel skills, but only because I'm friends with the executive director. I guess see if you know anyone that works for a small non-profit.

I would also say move ahead with caution. Sometimes advanced Excel solutions require more maintenance then you are able to provide or could create more problems if you're not available to fix something when it breaks. 
If you know anything about accounting/bookkeeping/finance I'm sure a not-for-profit would really appreciate it. A lot of analysis can be done quite quickly by someone with pretty good excel skills and couple really help!
I don't know what state you live, but I volunteer through New York Cares. They offer computer courses for individuals who are unemployed. I'm pretty sure Excel fits under this umbrella. 
I do every Saturday. I do the administration for a youth club, i do their data collection, analysis and reporting to submit for more funding. Successfully done so since 2007. Takes me 3 hours on a Saturday to keep them running for another week. 
I volunteer at a soup kitchen type thing.  I use Excel to keep track of inventories and automatically generate shopping lists for different people with a VBA script I wrote.

Thats basically [assurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assurance_services) and is a very valuable service.
