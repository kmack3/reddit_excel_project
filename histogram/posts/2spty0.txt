Does anyone know where I can get sample data sets to practice for an excel skills interview?

Out of curiosity... What kind of job screens you through am excel interview?
The YouTube channel MrExcel has practice worksheets with each tutorial.
.gov websites.  Census Bureaus and  Bureau of Labor Statistics are two good ones.  It's almost all numerical data though, so you'll want to find some text data too.

US Dept of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics has lots of data sets, some CSV, some Excel workbooks. Poke around at http://www.bls.gov/data/
This is a great call and I didn't know I could search like this.

I had to take an excel test for a project coordinator position. I would guess pretty much any business or data analyst position could be subject to one. 
When I went for an interview for an accounting internship around 5 years ago they gave me an Excel skills test. It was pretty basic though, I think the most complicated piece was an IF statement
I recently interviewed for an operations analyst position.  The first portion of the interview included an excel test (vlookup, pivot table, etc).  

The interviewer reported that interviewees' resumes frequently list skills that the interviewee does not possess.  The test was fairly basic, but it would have weeded out anybody unaccustomed to using those tools on at least an occasional basis.
I just graduated with my MBA and most consulting, finance, and strategy jobs will put you through your paces on Excel. Additionally I need to demonstrate proficiency with Powerpoint and deliver some type of presentation. This is in addition to the other comments here. 

The specifics differ based on the industry you enter in but pivot tables and vlookups are guaranteed to be a part of any test. 
Flip over to the solved section sometime too, helps when you want answers to a problem.
