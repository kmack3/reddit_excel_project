Starting a project at work...
Hey, I'm a consultant and what you're describing is pretty much a thing we do in our firm. To nail down the concept and understand what you need to get the "optimal promotion" I'd suggest you read about Revenue Management and pricing analytics. Basically, you need to segment your demand, determine the effect of several variables on your sales (this can be done with statistical analysis), define the optimal price with your demand curve, including your inventory levels so you don't lose sales to stock-out.

Once you know what you have to do, you can plug the access database to an excel spreadsheet using the built-in sql engine, and use that data to forecast and run statistical models to get the price and the promotions right at whatever level of detail you want (category, sky, channel, location, you name it).

Try to make the spreadsheet that suits yours and your business's needs, and when you hit a wall, come back to us and I'm sure someone will help once the issue has been narrowed down.

Good luck!
First thing comes to mind would be looking at ROI and see how much you return from each dollar spent.

Then in addition you need to be able to forecast your sales volume to under the optimal profit margin.

I can't particular help with the excel build part but just some insights into your potential options.
You should learn how to make paragraphs. You also should learn how to get to the point. Hard to find  the question in this gigantic wall of text.
