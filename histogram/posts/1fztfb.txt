51 New Excel 2013 Functions
Web functions - amazing. Time to throw out all of my poorly written web scraping scripts. 
XOR,  am I missing something? Shouldn't it only return true if only one of the parameters is true?
I so could have used that DAYS function a couple projects ago. Oh well.
they should add a new vlookup, which works both ways (YES I KNOW WE CAN USE INDEX for that)
when the hell are they going to add a principle components or cluster analysis-type function? 
I use [Web Content Extractor](http://www.newprosoft.com/web-content-extractor.htm) right now for some stuff. It's awesome and incredibly easy to use. It parses pages into a spreadsheet, and exports as txt, csv, Access, xml, and a number of other formats. Makes scraping/excel-ing an easy two step process.
it's not too bad - [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyst4A18gis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cyst4A18gis)
you're right. i need to update that. thanks! (JUST UPDATED)
That seemed funny to me as well.
=ROUND((End Date-Start Date),0)

As long as the start and end dates are referenced cells on your spreadsheet.
Because excel stores dates as numbers, this formula will give you the difference aka the number of days in between.

The rounding function, can give you an integer (when zero is plugged into the formula, as above), or you can round further using a negative number (eg -1) to give a more general estimate.
you can use the magic formula called "-" (minus ;-) )
I think it's safe to say never, unless you want to trust a newer data analysis toolkit. (You don't.) But, hey, that's why they let us have flairs.
