Excel 365 just blew my mind away. Cool "new" (?) feature!
It's called [Flash Fill](http://office.microsoft.com/en-gb/excel-help/use-autofill-and-flash-fill-RZ103988276.aspx).
I saw the Flash Fill on reddit last week or so. And started using it - it was working great.

Now with the same data source, it won't work.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get it to work again? I've even tried the manual, menu button and it gives the warning to try a few more. Last week, the first 3 were enough, this week, 5 samples isn't enough....

Weird - says Excel 2013 - but I've never seen it triggered 
It may depend on how complicated the logic is. I've found that 3-5 is what is needed.
It triggered for me last week for the first time.  I had Column A full of company names in all caps, and I wanted them to look normal (first letter caps, rest of letters lower).  I typed in the first company name in Col. B, hit enter, and started the second name, and it filled all of them.  It was a huge time saver.  The one issue it was having was with companies where they may have LLC or something at the end, it just recognizes this as a word and returns Llc.  Oh well.  Great feature in my opinion.
you can also use the proper() formula to get the same thing, fyi.
Yes, but flash fill is nice for when you have something that requires complicated nested text formulas to convert. I find it beneficial for splitting information apart.
