How to Cold-Email Many Personalized Job Applications with Excel
just a tip, mostly personalized emails are much better.
Quality > Quantity.
You should modify your application and cv according to the position you are applying for. Put an emphasis on certain skills or experience which would benefit in the unique job. This will return in a much better reponse-quota than cold-emailing recruiters!
This can be done using mail merge in Word in conjunction with an Excel spreadsheet as your data set, provided you have Outlook set up with the email address that you plan to use. The spreadsheet would contain the personalized data including names, email addresses, etc. The word document would contain the body of the email with fields set up to pull the requisite info from the data set.

I am not sure how to do this in Excel. However, I do have a google doc setup to do this (my email domain is on google apps) - "Yet Another Mail Merge" 

I make a draft in my email, add whatever fields I want. Then I can run the script in the sheet. Bam. Email.   It also adds a status and date to my google sheet.

There are quite a few ways to approach this.

Sorry - hit edit too soon.  

You could probably look at the script in Google and edit it for Excel if you do not use gmail or google apps.
