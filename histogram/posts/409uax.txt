CURRENT CLIPPY STATUS REPORT NO: 09012016
Thank you for your work!

And I'm (somewhat) new - what does "forward to award your clippy points" mean?
Happy to see the Clippster back, and sporting some fancy new hardware at that.
Just FYI, ro**ug**e is makeup. A ro**gu**e is someone who goes off on their own.
Clippy: O HAI! I see you are still running XP! Mmm... nom nom, delicious, smooth, easy XP! It's so nice in here! I could just stay here forever! Do remember Microsoft Bob? He was a really good pal of mine! I'd like you to email him now, OK? [Here we go](bob@ms.wtf)^click
Who pays for this? Also, thanks for the time the mods invest in /r/excel as that is surely worth more than the Clippy upgrade.  
Looks like Clippy is out of luck today...
It doesn't appear that flairs are being updated, is Clippy having issues today?
Doh, forget, not forward!  Thanks and fixed!
Of course it is makeup! Clippy is getting a makeover. Geeze.
lol thanks! fixed!

Hi!  It looks like you're looking for help with an Excel function!    
Unfortunately I have not learned that function yet. If you'd like to
change that, [message the
moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fexcel)!

No one pays for Clippy directly - /u/fearnotthewrath has it running in his home, so you could say he does.

Thank you for the kind words, we try our best to keep a high standard!
Clippy appears to be working fine at the moment.

Can you point out what's affected?
Thanks, it looks like epic awarded the point.  This may have been part of the issue we were having with the script "paused" for a good part of the day.
Clippy, go home, you're drunk. Drunk on Windows 10!
You got the specific post I was having issues with - not sure if his solution verified wasn't picked up because he had it in formatting or what.

There are some older threads that look like they may have been missed, during the downtime, however...

(This one looks to be missing the "suggestion" to verify a solution)

All done, thanks for the good spot!
Have to keep tabs on my fake internet points! :)
I don't know about Karma - but ClippyPoints are the real deal. Put that shizzle on your CV/Resume.
What's the ideal way for us to report instances where an OP disappears after a solution is provided? Do you guys want a modmail report?
If the OP disappears, then it stays that way until they come back.

After around a week, Clippy posts a warning post that they're thread will be marked as abandoned.

We tend to manually award points where OP has stated somewhere that they have their solution but haven't awarded a clippypoint or marked the thread as solved.

We don't want to close out other threads where OP hasn't said a post is correct (unless they're blatantly obviously correct, like "What does the fill tool do!").

But for other posts, just message me directly for now and I'll sort it out.
