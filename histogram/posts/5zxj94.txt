If cell A1 = Yes, then change the color of cell A2. How?
Use conditional formatting. With cell A2 selected, go to the Home Tab on the Ribbon > Conditional Formatting > New Rule > Use a formula to determine which cells to format and enter the following formula:

    =IF(A1="Yes",1,0)

You can change the format to what you like using the format button. 
Conditional formatting! Really easy to do and one of my favorite features.
Even shorter...

    =A1="yes"

Was trying to figure out this same issue last week.
