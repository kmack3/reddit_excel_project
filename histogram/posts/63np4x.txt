Formula to leave a cell blank if return value is an error?
=iferror( formula, "")
Use IFERROR
So your `AND` syntax is off - you're saying L6 must be true (so any nonzero value), M6 can't equal `""`, L6 must be  true, and M6 must be true. So as soon as you put a non-zero value in M6, N6 will show the work days. I think you want `=IF(AND(L6<>"",M6<>""),NETWORKDAYS(L6,M6),"")`.

Anyway, to add the NA to that,

    =IF(AND(L6<>"",M6<>"",M6<>"N/A"),NETWORKDAYS(L6,M6),"")

or if you mean a proper #N/A! error,

    =IF(AND(L6<>"",IFNA(M6,"")<>""),NETWORKDAYS(L6,M6),"")
Display the Excel Options dialog box.
At the left side of the dialog box, click Formulas.
Clear the Formulas Referring to Empty Cells check box.
Click on OK.

Or use IFERROR before the formula.
Maybe

    =IF(COUNTIF(L6,">0")*COUNTIF(M6,">="&N(L6)),NETWORKDAYS(L6,M6),"")
I tried it and nothing. This is what I entered:

=IFERROR(IF(AND(L6,M6<>"",L6,M6),NETWORKDAYS(L6,M6),""))
Still not working. I get the #value! on N6. What I'm trying to do is if any value other than a date is entered in M6, then the return value for N6 will be a blank cell. 
Not ,"")) but ),"")
     =IFERROR(IF(AND(L6,M6<>"",L6,M6),NETWORKDAYS(L6,M6),),"")

`=IF(IFNA(AND(M6>0,ISNUMBER(M6)),FALSE),NETWORKDAYS(L6,M6),"")`
Thanks! Solution Verified!
