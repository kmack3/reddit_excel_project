How Do I Graph by Zip Code Data
Yeah take a look at [Power Map](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-Power-Map-88a28df6-8258-40aa-b5cc-577873fb0f4a). It will plant the data on a map and has the capability to do a heat map as well. Best part is it's free.
Yeah, look up [Power View](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Power-View-Explore-visualize-and-present-your-data-98268d31-97e2-42aa-a52b-a68cf460472e), a free Microsoft tool for Excel. If you qualify for it (2013 or later), there's some example code out there to get familiar with it.

Google offer the capability graph zip codes. I wish I could the recall the exact process. I think it was Google fusion..."tables"?
I know this isn't exactly the most affordable solution, but Tableau offers this functionality built in, and it's pretty easy. 
Download tableau public...that's how.
Google Fusion Tables and [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) are both good options.

Have fun! I love working with geographical data.
This is actually built in to the most recent iteration of Excel -- nothing extra to have to install.
Thanks this is very close to what I am looking for. Is it possible to see the data in a heat map that shows higher density with darker colors?
Tableau public is free
No idea.

If you need more functionality than what Power View can give you, look into [feeding your Excel file to R](https://uchicagoconsulting.wordpress.com/2011/04/18/how-to-draw-good-looking-maps-in-r/).  It has a steep learning curve but is extremely flexible.  I know for a fact you could do a map with [color gradients with very little code](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/11/choropleth-challenge-result.html).
Cartodb  will do a heatmap  (chloropleth). You just need to genocode the data first! Cartodb is awesome. 
It's called choropleth, not a heatmap. Don't know if that software has it.
