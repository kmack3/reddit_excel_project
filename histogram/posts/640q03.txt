Job Interview today with Excel test - Would like to know if I'm prepared.
OP I don't have any guidance for you (sorry!) but please update us with what was on the test! 
Formulae aside, presentation of data is just as important - so make sure things are clear and concise.  

Get and Transform (used to be Power Query prior to 2016). If you don't have it, it's a free add-on from Microsoft and probably already installed, it just needs to be activated. Also, Text to Columns.
The key lies in being able to merge those formulas to create a bigger picture. For example extracting parts of a cell with MID() based on the LEN() of the text.
Or concatenating cells to create a unique identifier which can then be used for INDEX/MATCH, etc.

This is partly formula knowledge, but mostly experience. Don't worry if you don't have this yet, you're off to a good a start, just don't start "memorizing" formulas. That's rarely useful.
Know your shortcuts. 

Transform the sheets in a way that they are easily readable with minimal amount of formatting. 

Layout your sheets horizontally and don't cram multiple (possibly unrelated) tables on a sheet. 

Before creating an unreadable mess of nested ifs and vlookups, consider using VBA.
I have noticed many excel work 'tests' examine your use of hot keys. I would brush up by asking yourself, is there a way I can do 'x' with out using the mouse.
I just had one of these. It went terrible. 

I had to produce a dashboard to display some dummy data. So i used my fitness stuff. It works, but I'm no excel whizz so it probably wasn't what they were looking for. 

And then they dropped four formula one me at the end and wanted me to identify what the formula did. Wasn't prepared for that.

I hope you did better.
I am interested about what is on it. I feel like you can do 95% of anything you would need with basic formulas, ifs, and vlookup to do 95% of anything you would need to do functionally, but tests can often focus on corner cases and lose context of purpose. 
I had an excel test for a data analyst role around about six months ago, it was fairly basic. I just had to show an understanding of VLOOKUPs/Pivot Tabes/Conditional formatting and graphs. 

I think they'll want to know that you're able to do basic things and worry about the more complicated stuff when you're hired.

Good Luck.
Seems fine. I would ask for the power query equivalents to check if the candidate's knowledge is up to date. 


learn keyboard shortcuts
You're gonna do well, dude.

I've been on both sides of these tests and if you actually know those functions (and understand when to use them) you will probably score better than 95% of applicants. I've seen people who struggle with copy and pasting, can't do a VLOOKUP, don't know any text functions, and have never even heard of VBA. These same people usually have "proficient in Excel" on their resume. 

So good luck, but in the mean time don't stress out about it at all.
Hope you do well, dude. I just started as a technical analyst, using Excel all day. I'm realllly glad I didn't have a test for it, though. 
Good luck to you :)
Transpose is always a good one. How did it go?
They will probably provide you with a fake data dump and ask you to analyze the data. If you can do the above, plus pivot tables, sumifs(), countifs(), etc. you will be fine. The difference between a good analyst and a great analyst is the skill to analyze and present the data. If you can create a summary that tells a story, you will be fine. VBA isn't needed so I wouldn't worry about it.

If you really want to **WOW** your new boss(es), doing everything without a mouse will earn you a ton of brownie points.
Commenting for update 
Don't forget to dazzle the with end mode.
Did it go well?
Sumif and Countif are also important ones to know. Also Sumifs and Countifs for more specific data sets. Pivot tables will be valuable to know as well.
Iferror() is always a good one. Index(match() as well.
Will do!

All they really had me do was format, call cells and use the concatenate function.
I'm sorry to hear about your experience. Mine was really easy, thankfully. I don't know why it wasn't more difficult, didn't really need to use any functions other than concatenate.
It went well. It was so easy, I started writing VBA code because I thought they wanted me to work with the messy formatting but all they really had me do was clean up the formatting and do simple things like calling cells and using the concatenate function. But I can tell the VBA code worked in my favor as my would be boss commented that skill would be useful for more difficult projects.
From my experience in corporate finance/accounting the above usually constitutes the "advanced" excel skills people are looking for.  Everyone else is looking for VBA.
What is the power query? Sorry, I've never heard of that. I'm familiar with queries in SQL.
Thanks man, it went really well. It was so much easier than I expected. I didn't expect it to be too difficult, it was just not that hard at all.
Thanks man. My would be boss said I did great.

Commenting to check on test later.

Good luck!!
RemindMe! 5 hours "excel test"
RemindMe!
I had to look up what that does because I'm noob...

Maniacal! 
Good to hear! GL, hope you get the job.
No problem. Power query is basically a way to use SQL for people that do not know SQL. It is called Get and Transform in Excel 2016 and is super awesome.
Good stuff mate, glad you did well! Here's hoping you land the job!
It's been 3 hours. RIP OP

Thank you! Never knew about this but I have Excel 2016 and I did find Get and Transform on there. Will mess around with it a bit.

Let's hope they did so well on the job that they got hired immediately and are celebrating already!
Can you give me any tips on learning VBA? There's a 1 hour YouTube video I found in this subreddit that I'm going to watch next week but any other free resources would be much appreciated!

Thanks!
Good on you mate. Hope you get it.
Can you expand on why you chose to use VBA? Did they say it was a daily report that needs cleaning everyday or something similar to that?
well done :)
I didn't get hired immediately, but my would be boss said my excel skills are top notch. So that part went well at least.
If you want to really learn it well, I would start with a language like C and understand programming fundamentals a little bit. I feel like VBA allows you to be sloppy with your programming to be honest but if you can understand how to use objects and things like that then it will make your VBA code much better and more efficient.

Here is a cool little website for C (very basic tutorials nothing too advanced for each topic):

http://www.learn-c.org/

Another good website:

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/

I'm not a programming expert by any means but learning C and Python a bit and delving into programming fundamentals made me a much better VBA programmer.
VBA isn't too difficult to learn to the point where you can start doing useful things. Start with a few online lessons and try writing code to do some repetitive task that you often have to do at work or something.

At first you can use the macro recorder to give you an idea of where to start but the code will be pretty bad. Can still be useful in snippets though.

Another thing to do as you progress is to organize and keep useful snippets. For example, a small sub routine to check if a file or folder exists could be used in many different future projects.
I thought I had to work with the messy formatting they gave me (I misunderstood) and additionally I kind of wanted to show that I could use VBA to be honest. All I did was write a while loop and copy values of cells from one sheet to another but I think showing I could do that off the top of my head was beneficial. But once I realized how easy it was when he said you may not need to use VBA I just did that in 5-10 minutes. All I had to do was call values from one cell to another in different sheets, use concatenate(), delete rows, etc. You had to know how to call one cell repeatedly using F4. I'm glad I remembered that off the top of my head.
Good for you!!
Thanks!
Hi thanks for the advice. Yeah, I've used the macro recorder a lot but should make myself get into reading and modifying the code to get a handle on it. 

I've copied two subs off of websites to hide all sheets except the active one and also to unhide all sheets. 

Do you have any other ideas on little time savers like that?
A real timesaver can be formatting macros. I usually format tables, charts, etc in the same way. Write macros to automate this (select the chart/table and run the macro with a key combination).

I also have a couple of macros for paste-special values and paste-special formulas which I use a lot, again with a custom keyboard shortcut.

For ones that are used less frequently, I put them all in an add-in and have a shortcut to launch a form which lets me choose which macro I want to run. In there I have lots of stuff like exporting to pdf, exporting charts as vector images, formatting, deleting blank rows, importing external data, etc.

As you learn more VBA, put all your code snippets in an addin so you always have them handy and to house macros like the above.
