VBA: Appending/populating table when new sheet is created
[deleted]
Thanks for getting back to me.


This looks spot-on. Since the rows have to be dynamic (@ end of table), would this be an appropriate way to define the range?

	Dim LastRow as Long


	LastRow = Range("B" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row
	Range("B8:B" & LastRow).Formula = "=B1+2"
	Range("C8:C" & LastRow).Formula = "=C1+2"


Edit: Forgot to mention - really appreciate the help.

You certainly saved me some grief; I only intend to apply the formula to the LastRow. 


Thanks again; very much appreciated. Looks much better than the jumbled mess that I would have turned out!
