Is there a "Code Academy" for Excel? (Interactive tutorials)
Check out [WiseOwl Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNIs-AWhQzckr8Dgmgb3akx_gFMnpxTN5) -  It's a video series on youtube. The instructor does an amazing job at introducing VBA to beginners. He even goes into File Dialogs, Word, Powerpoint, Outlook, and Active X Data Objects. 

I was able to learn the fundametnals from this series, and have been creating some amazing workbooks in Excel.

Similar to the above poster's answer is excel exposure, which has great videos and a downloadable spreadsheet to go with for examples. 
This guy is brilliant, too[Your programming network vba](http://www.yourprogrammingnetwork.co.uk/vba-2010/)
I highly recommend trying out "Excel is Fun" on Youtube.  The guys are super easy to follow, very informative, and go in depth on pretty much anything relevant.  They provide you the spreadsheets to follow along.   The lessons are anywhere between 5 and 90 minutes long.  10/10 you will learn.   https://www.youtube.com/user/ExcelIsFun
My community college I attended offered classes on the various Microsoft word programs, and they used Simnet. 

http://decasoftware.com/ has more information

BUT we had to pay money to get an account. I'm not sure if that was only for the grading aspect or not. And I'm not sure if there needs to be a teacher associated with it or not. 

It was really good for teaching all the aspects of the program. I only took it for the Database one. It had multiple chapters and each chapter had a lesson, a 'video' where you watched it do everything, and then a practical part where you did it yourself within a simulation. 
If you want to learn Microsoft Excel, there are several places on the net that offer online courses. The one I personally like is http://www.onlinecourses.train.... They have videos and pdf course packs like most online course. But they also have lots of assignments you can use to practice the concepts. There are simulated exercises also which are basically guided practice sessions and very helpful.
