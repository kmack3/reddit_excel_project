Documents I've used for years now open with a page break cutting off the last column. Any ideas?
Are your printer margins changed?
Maybe one of the column widths changed. Anyway, you can go to print settings and choose Fit Sheet on One Page.
Did you get a new printer or print driver? Or maybe just changed which is your default printer?
Is your default paper size US or International? Letter or A4?
Font, or font size change in Excel?
Did you change printers?

Because that's what happens when you change printers.
My issue is I have hundreds of these templates, I can't expect to go into each document and change it to print to one page or page width one. It was working and now its not. I'm hoping to find out why its not. I didn't change something on every document.
It's a network printer, i'm inquiring with IT if we rolled up new drivers. I've switched to a new printer and it still opens older templates with the break.

I've looked into both of those items, but sadly there wasn't an issue.

I've also opened the documents on other computers on our network, and it does not have the same problem, so I think i'm narrowing it down to my PC specifically.

No, when the document is opened the page break exisits. A document I haven't opened since 2014 will have it, without any changes.


I wonder if Excel had some update that triggered this.
Did the page break exist before between Z and AA?
There was an office update the last go around, but as always, they are so vague as to what is changed. 
Yes. I set my Print Area to be A-Z, so AA is not a field that has data or is printed. The document is set to only print one page in width.
