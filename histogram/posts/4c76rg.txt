Just wanted to say a quick thanks!
I hope you continue to excel!

Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
You're welcome :) In all seriousness every career advancement I've had was due to having the ability to use Excel at a high level.
I second the thanks - people reading and helping here could do anything else in the world...instead they use their precious time to help strangers solve problems that they could easily ignore.  Thank you all greatly.
Very cool and good to know! Congratulations! 
I agree with this so much. Thank you to all that contribute! You're amazing and have made many of our lives so much easier.  Thank you!!!!!
I third the thanks - my life has never been easier after I found this subreddit. Thanks for all the great answer, dear contributors.
yw and congratulations! Also a big thanks to you (and everyone else who asks questions on here) - without you, we wouldn't have a sub! So keep it up! :D
