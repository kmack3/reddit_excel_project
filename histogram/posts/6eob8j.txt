Custom Ribbon button does not trigger macro
Is the macro loaded into your personal macro workbook?
If you save the macro as a module in your personal workbook, it should be accessible via ribbon button on an sheet you load.
Post the XML for the ribbon button please.
I exported all modules/forms/classes from my file

created a new empty file

imported everything

edited the xml again (exactly the same as the old file)

and now it is working. I have no idea what happened.

No. It is a separated workbook. My goal is to create an addin, but for now is just a regular xlsm file. 
But I don't want to save it on my personal workbook. I want it to be saved on the same workbook as the ribbon is.

The ribbon appears just in this file. I edited the XML for this particular file and added the ribbon and the button.

I have done this a dozen times, but know it is not working for this file and I don't know why.
