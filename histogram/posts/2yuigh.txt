Reminder: Free 10-week "Introduction to Excel VBA Programming" course starts soon
Enrolled and excited! I love trying to automate excel, and this will at least partially decrease the problem as stated here: http://xkcd.com/1319/

I hate repetition in excel and will follow the xkcd method to the point where I almost get nothing done some days. 
Is there are minimum recommended skill level?
is it push or pull driven?  do i have to come looking for lessons or are they going to be emailed out? 
Thanks, I think I signed up. How do I know for sure? What time/days are the courses?
I signed up, but wanted to ask if the blackboard app works with the class with the username and password I created on the website? I've been looking for a class like this and I am really excited for it!
Hi,

I've enrolled when you initially advertised it here back some time ago and sorry if this have been answered, but must we do it live when you are teaching or can we do it on our own leisure?

I'm from Asia and I think my time is totally flipped so I'm wondering how would that work. Can I get through a couple of past lessons at one go or I must do it on that day itself?

Thanks!
In layman's terms, could you explain what we would theoretically be able to do once we complete the course. I'm very interested
.
Looks cool I signed up. I definitely don't have 5 to 10 hours but I am interested in watching some videos as my time permits.
I don't want to sound demanding but could you please remind us again one day before the course starts? I'm quite looking forward it.
Will this course be offered again later in the year?
Thank you! 
Please keepup the good reddiquette by setting the correct flair!
thanks for the reminder, I missed the original post
I have signed up.  I just tried writing a code for a repetitive task at work yesterday and I loved that when it worked.  I guess I will love this course.  Thank you in advance.  Looking forward to it. 
THANK YOU! I made a big splash at an internship over 10 years ago just by knowing a few basic things in VBA, this should help me get back on track and also help anyone else that needs some marketable skills. This is excellent. Thank you again.
My fiance signed up for this, and I'll be giving her help & tutoring on the side. So please do a good job or I will hunt you down....

Seriously though, thank you for this. She's been bugging me to teach her stuff for awhile but I am not a good teacher for more than about 5 minutes.
In! Thanks for the reminder.
Is there a syllabus? I do a lot of tedious Excel work everyday and am familiar with programming, I'd love a more thorough breakdown of the course objectives if possible. 
Thanks, just enrolled!
Dropping in to say thank you Paul. Have enrolled and have passed to team at work. Am very much looking forward to this and will be valuable for my job! Top man!
"Success: You are now enrolled in Introduction to Excel VBA Programming"

Woot woot!  Thanks Paul!
The course looks really interesting. When do you plan next edition? Unfortunately I have no time to take it now but I'd love to take it another time!
Hi there!  Will you offer something similar for Microsoft Access? Just curious. 
thanks for this info. im in from colombia.
I just now saw this post when searching for vba for excel help through reddit.  Is there an opportunity to enroll late?? I am taking a Computer Info. Systems course and we touch on Excel and Access, and I am learning C#, but want to refine my skills in another language such as the object-oriented VBA model.  There is nothing like this at my school.  I attend University of Louisville.
Hello. I'm a little late to the party - is there any way of enrolling / getting access to the course content now?

VBA definitely can help with automation.
I will assume you know nothing about Excel or VBA coming into the course.
All content will be on the course website, and the website and lessons will be organized in a very user-friendly manner. 

Each week I will send out an email to the class to make sure everyone knows what to do for the week.
You should see a message that the course will start on March 30 when you go on the website (actually, the course will open up for a preview phase on March 15). You also will receive an email on the 15th with more information about the course. Send me a pm if you don't receive an email by March 16.
I don't quite understand the question.

If you just registered on Open Education and enrolled in the course, you should be good to go.
The videos aren't live so you should be good to go!
You will have an entire week to complete each set of lessons. So you will have some freedom in the course.
Once you learn programming, the sky is the limit. 

For most people though, it will help them automate tasks or build special functions in Excel. You will become much more efficient at handling spreadsheets.
If you enroll in the course, you will receive email reminders.
Unfortunately no. There will be only one opportunity to earn a certificate. However, if you enroll you will be able to access the material for a while after the course is over.
Whoops. I will look into this.
You definitely can impress people by building simple programs in VBA since most people don't realize Excel has that capability.
I better step up my game then.
You will be able to download the syllabus in a few days when I grant access to the course website.
The more, the merrier.
woot indeed.
Unfortunately, we don't have plans to reoffer the course in the future. I will post a notice on reddit if we do offer it again.
Unfortunately no. Just MS Excel.
Welcome!
Sorry. We are entering Week 3 and for assessment purposes I need to stick to the enrollment cutoff date.
If we offer the course again, I will post an announcement on reddit.
Sorry. For assessment purposes we cannot let in new students. If we offer the course again in the future we will post on reddit.
5-10 hours a week is a good chunk of time. Is this live stream or on demand video? 
Oops just saw in the post above you will be emailing all who enroll. My bad.

I will make sure I look for that email. 
Thanks again for the repost!
Thanks!
Thanks!! Looking forward to it!
Well, that's a pity. I really hope you will offer it again. At least, will the materials be available online after the course is finished?
Thank you, Professor.  Can you offer in one sentence any advice on the best approach for learning the VBA model for excel?  
I struggle with when to use a userform vs. module vs. class module.
There will be 42 video lessons total, with each video typically lasting ~5-10 minutes and covering just one concept. For most videos, concepts are introduced using animated PowerPoint slides, followed by a simple worked example. 

Each week a new topic will be learned and students will complete the following six tasks:

1) Read the week’s learning objectives and watch a brief (~1 min) introduction video that provides an overview of the topic.

2) Watch 3-7 short video tutorials that discuss concepts related to the week’s topic. The videos will be on-demand and will total 30-60 minutes per week. You won't be watching live videos.

3) Complete an ungraded "sanity-check quiz" for students to self-assess whether they understand the concepts discussed in the videos. Feedback will be provided if the student provides incorrect answers.

4) Complete an ungraded "pre-quiz" which asks students to predict the output from a VBA program. Students can check their answer with Excel.

5) Complete a graded quiz that has similar content to the pre-quiz.

6) Write VBA programs to solve 2-3 problems using concepts learned in the video tutorials. The problem statements will include hints to help beginner students and extra tasks for more advanced students. The programs can't be graded due to the difficulty in setting up an automated grading system, but solutions will be provided at the end of the week. Class discussion boards will allow participants to receive help with their programs (~10-15 undergraduate student assistant volunteers who know VBA well will be helping me and the assistant instructor, Dr. Todd Coburn).
 
5-10 hours indeed is a good chunk of time, but learning how to program requires a lot of work. If you already know how to program in another language, it likely will take you less time since you already understand programming logic.
If you sign up for the course now, you will be able to access the materials for a while after the course is completed. Enrollment will end on April 5.
Actually, one of the best books for beginners is "VBA for Dummies" by John Walkenbach. He also made a more advanced book called "Excel 2013, Power Programming with VBA"
Already putting in 40 hours a week behind the desk doing Excel VBA - at the very least excited to get a certificate out of it finally haha - looking forward to see what's being offered.
I know some vba, teaching an Excel course tomorrow in fact. But I'm not formally trained I've just got ~20 years experience of working with spreadsheets and Excel and use it daily. But I run my own business as a consultant (web analytics and conversion rate optimisation) and have a young family so the time factor might be prohibitive 
Thank you.  This is invaluable.
Maybe you could help others on the discussion board. :)
There is no penalty for not completing the course since it is free. If you don't want to do the exercises, you could sign up for the course and just watch the videos which would be just a much smaller time commitment (~30-60 min/week).

Well already plan on getting some of the new hires involved in this class who have expressed interest, I'll be sure and keep an eye out on the discussion board as time permits.
Thanks I've signed up and will see how I get on
