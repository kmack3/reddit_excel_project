Using Excel to solve a variable on the right hand side of the equation from multiple cells
What's the overall general formula for this type of calculation, as we're not all rocket scientists =P
Starting with the 2nd formula,

(A*/A)/1.728 = M / (1 + 0.2 M^2 )^3

call the LHS b.

(1 + 0.6 M^2 + 0.12 M^4 + 0.008 M^6 ) = M/b

0.008 M^6 + 0.12 M^4 + 0.6 M^2 - M/b + 1 = 0  [edited]

That should be easy enough to solve using Newton or Secant methods.  
You can use VBA to call solver / goal seek in each row if you know how to use them. That's how I usually do this kind of problem.
Excel crunches data easily, but doesn't do mathematical equations like this. 

What I would do is put the equation into Wolfram Alpha with as many of the constants as you can, and then reproduce the solution for M into Excel. 
In Aerodynamics, this is called the Area-Mach number equation. There are plenty of [tabulated values](http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/cbe150a/isentropic_flow.pdf) that you can use to find the Mach number when given the ratio of areas, no need to do calculations when someone already has!
So what variables in the equation are unknown?  
This is more of an algebra question than an excel question. Solve for M algebraically so that all of the Ms are on one side of the equal sign alone, and everything else is on the other side. Then, whatever M equals, that's what you'll enter into the cell as your formula

So, if M = 2a / 3c

Plug into your M columns =2A / 3C

Obviously very simplified. But that's how this is done.
Forgot the link, apologies!
Yes, this.  Came in here to post about newton's method.  I do lots of excel voodoo using numerical methods.  I solve equations with no closed form solutions all the time with newton's method and look like a damned wizard.  All you need to know is derivative equation.
Indeed. This is the way to go.

Put two more columns, one for the "calculated A*/A" (col F) and another one for the "error" (col G). The use the "Goal Seek" tool to calculate the Mach (on column E for me) that sets the error to 0. Goal seek for every row with the code bellow:

      Sub Macro1()
          Dim N As Long
          For N = 2 To 12
            Range("G1")(N, 1).GoalSeek Goal:=0, ChangingCell:=Range("E1")(N, 1)
         Next N
      End Sub

Yeah, or a dedicated computer algebra system like Maxima. 

Is this secretly really an optimisation rather than tables of numbers problem?
I've included the simplified equation if it makes it any more straightforward for excel? And we know the left hand side of the equation.

I'll look into that thanks
That is very helpful actually thank you, but unfortunately I have to show the working for this report!
Just M.
 A*/A, on the left hand side of the equation, is calculated in the excel spreadsheet at 11 different points in 11 cells.
The best re-arrangement I can do though is (M^3 ) * (1+0.2M^2 ) on the left hand side. I can't get a singular M
Picky: in most cases Secant method for the first few iterations followed by binary search can be as fast and doesn't require derivatives.

This might help
What is this homework?  
If youre trying to work backwards- finding the Mach number from the area ratio- you need to use employ a numerical analysis like Newton-Raphson method. 

[Here's what I found on Google,](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/winddocs/utilities/b4wind_guide/mach.html) you can try working it out from this. 
So....you're asking someone to solve the equation for M then?
I'm learning stuff.  Never used the secant method...will look into this.  I suppose we should also preface that you need to write custom vba functions to pull this off.  I have seen this done in excel only, but it's very ugly.

Thx for the tip!
Yeah, for each point. Sorry if I've confused anything.
