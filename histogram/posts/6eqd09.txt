Can I make a macro that takes a CSV, saves it with a different title (with current date) and to XLS?
     [workbook].saveas [filePath] & format(date, "yyymmdd") & ".xls", fileformat:=xlnormal

Where you should replace `[workbook]` with the actual name of the object or file you're working with, and `[filePath` with the directory where you want to save
