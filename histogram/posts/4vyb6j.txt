Let's say I use the $ symbol to lock on a cell and copy data into 1600 lines. How do I remove the $ symbol from all the cells after that so I can copy the table into another tab?
Highlight the cells. Ctrl-H. Find `$` and replace with `<nothing>`
Also, highlighting the cells and then placing you cursor on $A$1 in the equation =$A$1+B1

And then press F4

it will toggle through all the absolute choices

Hey look one button solution
Replace all--> replace = with # --> copy paste --> replace # with =

Works for many other things as well
A lot of times what I'll do, especially for much larger tables, is create a copy of the current tab, then cut the copy's contents into the original tab and that preserves linkages.
Paste as values in the new table
I probably missed understood the question

But copy then Alt, e,s,v (paste special values)?
Thank you, it works!!

Let's say I did this, I have a collum of info and it is written as 

=$A$1+B1 (this one grows as in B2,B3..., while A1 stays, A1,A1...)

I then get rid of the $ on all of my 1600 lines. Now I have

=A1+B1

Is there a way of putting the $ back in the A1? I suppose I could do the same as with getting rid of it and doing find: A1, replace: $A$1?
Change it in the first cell then drag it to the bottom
Find replace A with $A$
Or this way, didn't think of it :D
Select the cell range within the formula (A1:C47, or A1, B2, B3, etc) and hit F4.  Hit multiple times to cycle through.

Find/Replace "A" is not a great solution.  There are lots of values in cells that could have an "A" in it that is not referencing the column
Solution Verified?
Yes.
