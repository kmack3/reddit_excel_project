Hey, I see you missed a few posts, I can help with that! (2016-07-04)
I don't want to start a new post just for this, so maybe someone can help me here! Excel noob who's looking for a one time help formatting a project I want to do. Short & Sweet I want to watch every episode of Star Trek (first time as I've never seen a single episode in my life) and have created this (crappy) excel sheet to keep a Captain's Log as I progress through... any help in formatting it make it look much better would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance if someone could help!
