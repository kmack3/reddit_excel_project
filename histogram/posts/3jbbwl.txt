I'm almost there...
Congratulations! Now you can join the club of people going "ugh, VLOOKUP, as if!" :D

If you want to play around with it, try something like this:

A | B | C | 
:--- | :--- | :--- | 
1 | 4 | 7 | 
2 | 5 | 8 | 
3 | 6 | 9 | 


and then do: 

    =SUM(INDEX(A1:C3,0,1))

change the column number between 1-3. Then set column number to 0, and change the rows between 1 and 3. 

 
One of the best feelings. I usually fist pump shortly after.
Flair changed to discussion.
Thanks.
