Free Excel Maps for Developers, Managers, Analysts!
The "traffic light" KPI dashboard gave me a chuckle. Given that this is free, I think it's a fine resource. However, you should be aware that the the showcased dashboard images may turn people off, it doesn't come off as a legitimate, professionally polished dashboard that could actually be used in a business setting. Also, making a dashboard 3D and slanted isn't a design choice that makes the information very readable. Just my 2c opinion. 
Great resource! You should check out Stephen Few's book on dashboard design. Gauges aren't seen to be very useful, and there are alternatives that work much better.
Hmm.  This took a lot of work and you deserve to be commended on your skill.  But I don't see this as useful in a business setting.
Excellent site! Many thanks for sharing!
Thanks for your comment. Have a nice day!

Hello, thanks for your kind words. Offline Mapping in Excel is not too easy task. You can use also PowerBI if you are always online...

I didn't reply to you. I replied to /u/lost_in_portland who asked for a link to Stephen Few's book.
OK.
