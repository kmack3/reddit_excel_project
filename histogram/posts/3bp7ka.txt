A handy list of Excel hotkeys
If you really hate having to ever touch the mouse (like I do), the one nice thing about the ribbon is it makes it easy to learn a series of key strokes to do pretty much everything.  One that I use all the time is Ctrl+A to select all and then alt H O I which resizes everything to fit.  Alt H O R renames the tab.  Alt H V down arrow to paste special.
Ctrl + mousewheel up/down is one I like to use with excel and other things (browsers for one) to zoom in and out.
For Excel users that use macros, you may not know that instead of Ctrl+ a letter for a keyboard shortcut, you can hold down shift when entering the shortcut from the macro options to make it a Ctrl+shift+letter shortcut. This is especially helpful if you want to assign a shortcut to a letter that is already used by the app for other Ctrl shortcuts. 
Found this one earlier thanks to another redditor...

This showed up in lifehacks and got torn up in the comments as exceedingly basic. I'm surprised and simultaneously not surprised to see it here.
To paste special and match destination formatting: cntrl+v, cntrl, m
One that saves my butt is ctrl+d with a column selected to copy down a value without it increasing (ie you want to copy a date down 30 cells and have it stay static). Kinda works like double clicking in the bottom right corner of a cell without the value changing. 
This makes me even more sad to be forced to use a Mac at work QQ. I learned and excelled on a PC then get a great new job where all those Excel skills are practically worthless b/c of Mac...

Great post though!
ctrl+shift+L to filter/unfilter
Okay, this is one thing I haven't been able to replicate with keyboard shortcuts - clicking and dragging. Is there a way to do that? Dragging a formula down is nice because it works over filtered ranges unlike filling down. Is this even possible?
I'm still using the old keystroke shortcuts, like Alt, e, s for paste special. I should really make the switch, soon.
Cool, I was looking up hotkeys and found rename as alt+ OHR. Yours makes more sense as you can follow all the options. Kind of weird that going out of order works in this case.
Speaking of this, I wish Shift+Scroll wheel went left to right in excel.  Only program I use where this isn't the case.  
This one is waaaaaay better.
I found it in /r/geek and thought it would be useful here. Sorry if it's too basic for you.
Thanks! I just pinned the paste values button to my quick access row because I didn't know that one.
Alt+e, s, f (paste formulas only) is much better. There are many reasons for this: one is speed, another is that ctrl+v, ctrl, m will first copy & paste the formatting, then clear it. This will create unnecessary computations especially when pasting large data sets. 
I use the old one for a bunch of stuff, but anything I don't already know, I just go to the ribbon keys.  Fairly easy to learn since you get prompted as you begin.
x2 seems like it'd be a simple addition, too
Yah, that was it, actually. Did you read the comments at all there? They aren't positive.

Here's the top post, just for the hell of it:

>* Uses Excel 2010 logo
>* Points out universal keyboard shortcuts, not shortcuts specific to Excel (Really, Ctrl+C to copy?)
>* Corporate branding
>* The [QR link is dead](http://newhorizonsireland.ie/LocalWeb/Ireland/Excel-training-courses.aspx)

Other highlights include someone suggesting /r/forwardsfromgrandma as an alternative, and TotesMetaBot pointing out that /r/shitpost has linked to the submission.
I use all variations of this one. 

Alt e s v for values
Alt e s t for formats
Alt e s f for formulas
Alt e s m to multiply by the value (great if u have fields that are text and want to convert to numbers you just copy the number 1 and use this to paste)
Alt e s i to divide...

I'm could go on but once you hit alt e s, the screen pops up and you can easily look at the rest of the options.
