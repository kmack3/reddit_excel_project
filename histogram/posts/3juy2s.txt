No questions. Just wanted to give a shout out to /u/semicolonsemicolon!
Thanks dude. Much appreciated. Now someone (maybe me) is gonna have to kill this thread because it's not a question. <wink>  Flair changed to Advertisement.
Thanks again /u/crispytank but I need to delete this post. It doesn't conform to the sub's rules. Props to the others on here also. As much as you think I have the wisdom, I still find that I've learned quite a lot since joining this community.
What? Who is semicolon? And why are you shouting out?
You can delete if necessary. I just wanted to give thanks to a community that helps me daily and the power players involved. Cheers!
