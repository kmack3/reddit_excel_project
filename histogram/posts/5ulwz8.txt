How do I get excel to only show 1 page?
You cant stop at one page, but you can adjust the layout.

Go to VIEW in the ribbon, and pick Page Break Preview
Highlight the row after the last one you want to show,  press ctrl+shift+down to highlight all rows below it, then right click and select "Hide". 
Select the area you want to print by clicking and dragging over the cells. 

Go to: Page Layout > Print Area

Then go to: View >Page Break Preview, drag any dotted lines to where you want them.

You can then also hide all the columns to the right you don't want. It's a good strategy for sending out reports. 
However it causes the hidden rows to be calculated, sometimes causing unresponsiveness
