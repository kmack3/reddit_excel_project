How can I count the number of unique text cells?
    =SUMPRODUCT(--(FREQUENCY(MATCH(A1:A10,A1:A10,0),ROW(A1:A10)-ROW(A1)+1)>0))

Adjust the ranges as necessary. The final entry should be your first cell of data.
Pivot Table!

Specifically the Filter section (although you don't need to apply the filter).

Or I prefer, copying the column, remove duplicates button, then use a a COUNTIF formula against the original data.
FWIW, another alternative is

    =SUMPRODUCT(1/COUNTIF(range,range))-SIGN(COUNTBLANK(range))
just use your fingers man
You could always paste it into another column and remove duplicates and count them.
SOLUTION VERIFIED!
That's brilliant. I think I get most of it, but what's the double-minus ("--") for?
thank you! here's a gold.
I think I simplified it a little:

`=SUM(--(FREQUENCY(MATCH(column,column,0),ROW(column))>0))`

If not please let me know how so; I'm just learning this stuff

use

`=SUM(--(FREQUENCY(MATCH(column,column,0),ROW(column))>0))-1`

if there's a heading for column
Would you please give a breakdown of what's going on in this function step by step?

Why use sumproduct? Why does it return true or false? Because it's summing text? Using Match, row-row was used for what and what's the point of the > 0 at the end?


This was going to be my suggestion too. Easy to do without a formula. Pivot Tables combine duplicates.

It is to transform a valid formula from true/false to 1/0 since sumproduct is counting numbers not letters. Try any formula that returns true and wrap it with that and you will get 1.
If you hadn't of asked, I was going to! I agree, awesome solution!
There's a great breakdown of the formula here :

Cool! Thanks!
