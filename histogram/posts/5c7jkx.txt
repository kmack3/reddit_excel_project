Refreshing pivot tables/charts in Android phone?
How are you viewing it on your Android - with which app?
Maybe a little off topic because this is a Excel group, but I found that Hancom Office 2014 is an app that is almost exact to Excel (Desktop Version) and it even includes Pivot Table functionality. I've made some simple pivots and refreshes with some files on my tablet (Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014) and it worked great. In my opinion, and just within Android, it is a more complete app than Excel.
With excel. I tried clicking the tables but there's no refresh feature.
But is it compatible with MS Excel?
Not available on Android:

Quick google says yes, it can open xlsx, csv, etc
That sucks then. 
So it MIGHT also be able to refresh a pivot table...made in Excel.
