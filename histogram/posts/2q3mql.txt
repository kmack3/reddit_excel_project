About to ruin Reddit Secret Santa, getting errors when trying to export this CSV
If you want, PM me the file and I'll try to help; I'm also a Secret Santa, and I don't want anyone to have their experience ruined.  I also know you probably don't want to publish all of this private info here.  If you want, I'll also Skype with you if you need to.

Edit: I'll be home from work in about 3 to 3 1/2 hours and I can give more help.
Hey, sorry again about the confusion from our (reddit's) end -- total misunderstanding on what you were saying.

Let me know if you need anything else :)
Thank you so much for responding, but I literally just got it to import by saving it as a Windows CSV or something. When I did that, PayPal allowed me to actually edit the file and remove the things that was making it error without giving me the header issues. 
WOOHOO! I also wanted to help make this possible but figured you would not be able to send the file because of everyone's addresses and what-not. I am super happy to hear you got it though. :) Merry Christmas.
