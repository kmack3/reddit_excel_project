Is Excel proficiency more a product of knowing the software itself or having strong financial/mathematical skills?
It is a product of both and I would add logical reasoning. There are a lot of ways to skin a cat, knowing/being able to work out the best way to do it is important too.
Excel.TV had a great one with Oz  Du Soleil. He gave a great line "If someone can think data - you can teach them Excel. A fundamental logic of thinking and the relationship of understanding data is what you need." - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIvyKpKGQRU
I'm average at math. I'm an average accountant. I'm zip at computers. I'm average at logic. I'm the go to guy at work because I understand excel. I think it's more an understanding of what you want to achieve and thinking about how excel makes it work.  Product knowledge for me.
I believe a willingness to learn how as oppose to be told how.  My knowledge of Excel is all self-taught through Googling things I didn't know were possible.  A lot more people could be proficient but they choose the short term easy route of asking "the excel person" to do it for them, instead of long term efficiency of learning how it works.
My math sucks, but I'm pretty good at breaking a problem down into what I need to know, and figuring it out from there....

I'd say it's knowing the functions available, and understanding how to use a function.    Click the little fx near the formula bar, switch it to "all" and start reading.

[Once you know what functions you have available, you can stack them up to create the result you want.](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/32qr9j/how_do_i_skip_8_rows_when_i_drag_and_fill/)
Understanding the syntax (product) becomes so much easier once you know the logic behind the function.
Rule of 80/20, 80% is knowing Excel, 20% is having strong fin/math skills.
ah, understood. 

i am considering pursuing a financial analyst career (career transition) and trying to learn as much as possible about the application but i don't know what i don't know...if that makes sense. 
This, but I'd say with slightly less emphasis on mathematical/financial skills... obviously, working in the financial industry  - knowing those precepts - AND knowing how to apply and manipulate Excel functions around those principles will greatly increase your overall expertise, but there are a ton of Excel experts who do not work in the financial industry and do not know basic financial principles. Myself, I work in government and do very little with finance, but use fairly complicated formulas, including arrays, dashboards, and VBA to collect, analyze, and report various non-financial data... I have friends &amp; family who are very proficient in Excel and work in diverse industries, from engineering to insurance (risk projection), to education. 

EDIT: grammar
Exactly! Fill up a table with the headers A,B,C,... and fill it up with random numbers. Now try to do a pivot table with these information. This is what a pivot table is for someone who doesn't understand the data involve. It make no sense at all. The concept seems abstract and complicated. But if you understand the data involve, the pivot table it's so useful and easy to understand.
Wouldn't it be 20/80? 20% is knowing Excel, 80% is having strong fin/math skills?

This way, your knowledge base would not just be reliant on the Excel software, but transferable across different platforms?
Yeah if you have the financial knowledge you have known unknowns (i.e. how do I get this thing to do x) as opposed to having unknown, unknowns (i.e. wtf is x)
ive learned a lot lurking here and trying to answer questions. when i dont know how to answer a question, i pay attention to the correct answer and eventually understand more things.   

since doing this, ive learned:  
index(match())  
offset()  
len(), left(), mid(), right()  
indirect()  
row(), column()  
sheet()  
mod()  
sumproduct() as a logic operator instead of a simple summing of products
function of " -- " operator

and some other stuff


Take a look at [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/2znreq/a_guide_to_excel_for_finance/), it may help you out. Also come over to /r/finance!

(Full disclosure, I wrote the guide)
I'm sorry that I'm unable to answer your question, but I'm about to graduate from college and I'm attempting to pursue a financial analyst career. Do you have any resources you'd recommend?
The question starts with "is excel proficiency...".  Perhaps there is a bias toward thinking of Excel as a financial tool, but I am an excellent counter example.  My job is less than 1% financial, the other 99% is data manipulation.  I routinely write macros that turn hundreds of hours of manual data manipulation into a button click that produces "content" in a matter of minutes.  I will however concede that my math skills are better than average.
good point!
thank you!
Look for problems, and try to solve them with Excel.  Your level of proficiency and areas of weakness will show themselves clearly.  If you can work it out on pencil and paper, but not in Excel, then you need to work on Excel knowledge.  If you're working yourself in circles in both, then you need to focus on the math.

Don't get frustrated if your Excel sheets are unwieldy and not straightforward.  You'll get better at making things efficient and concise with time.
