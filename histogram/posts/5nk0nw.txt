This seems like the one subreddit where the harder your problem is, the more likely people will try to help
We Excel at challenges.
I don't always contribute, but when I do, it's because I'm bored of the non-Excel work I have to do at work.
I have a belief and I believe anything is possible on Excel. I've seen a playable Pac-man game on Excel for crying out loud.
For the easier questions it's hard not to want to respond "just Google it."

My physics teacher in high school always said he only wanted to teach us two things:
1. Life is not fair
2. Reading with comprehension

#2 is my favorite because I know that I can learn anything I want if I am willing to take the time--and I believe most people can too! But it is easier to ask for "ELI5: Index/Match plz."


This is a very quality sub.
I enjoy learning new things while solving interesting VBA problems.
This sub is amazing. So grateful to all the experts who help out! 
Ultimately I'm working towards a Microsoft Excel MVP status and this sub has been a great way to give back to the community. I don't really find the old boys clubs of some of the Excel Forums to be enjoyable with some people having 15,000 problems solved over 20 years slobbering all over their keyboard for the next post that comes in. It's very difficult for people coming into a world of solving others problems to feel like they truly have a chance to contribute. I'm proud to say I'm on the Clippy Board twice at this current moment with this account and my main profile /u/EddieMurphysGhost - I figured Microsoft would not want to see me talking about professional wrestling and pickle cat all of the time so I decided to go semi-professional to match my Excel training blog.
Seriously, all these guys are very very very helpful.

/r/whatstheword is similar. There's nothing bored domain experts love more than a challenge.
No offense but the harder my problems are the more I need to go to Mr Excel forums.
Hey dad!  I didn't know you were on Reddit.
Word. 
It helps to have access to the sub as well.

Real conversation that I have several times a day:

-I'm not sure if this can be done in excel but...

-Of course it can be done.

-But I didn't told you yet.

-No need. Excel can do anything.

Exactly, I've seen such neat stuff, that it opened my eyes a number of years ago, now I want to build all my projects and minor apps in excel.

Dynamic dashboards are especially fun, and can be amazingly intricate if you want them to be.
I saw advice along the lines of, if nobody is helping you when you're being nice / polite, act clueless enough so that others will answer you just to have a chance to insult your stupidity...
Had a physics teacher like this. Referred all questions to the book, and only taught when he was being supervised. Complete waste of time. 
sometimes it's cool to read up the "easy" stuff because even when googling it, you don't see the "cool alternative" that someone here knows.
As far as I'm concerned, if I have to post a question here it's Google that I'm failing at; it just means I couldn't phrase the problem properly
Lets default it.
your VBA solutions are great, I often refer to them when trying to figure out how to do something or am looking for input!
I'm glad it doesn't feel that way, that was always a concern with the clippy points. 

Obviously some people have a ton of clippy points and help out a lot of people, but with the scoreboard, I think /u/semicolonsemicolon made the conscious decision to not have it be a "top user" scoreboard, but rather highlight all the milestones, with an emphasis on the early ones (so I think it goes 10-25-50-100-200-...) and I really like that :)
Is [this](http://itsnotaboutthecell.com) you?
> No offense, but let me offend you.
You've made 29 posts in this sub, the current status of them is:



Status | Count
------|-----
Abandoned | 3
Discussion | 5
**Solved** | **17**
Unsolved | 3
Waiting on OP | 1

That's barely over 10% that are unsolved, your comment doesn't exactly to reflect the help you have received here.
the Mr Excel forums are great too, whenever I google problems I end up there half the time! It's not a competition lol, and we do have a bit of a different format here in terms of what "stays on top" as unsolved, that sometimes means if you don't get a reply early, your post might get kind of forgotten. 

But please do keep posting questions here, otherwise there'd be nothing for people to answer! And if you find an answer somewhere else to a question you couldn't get answered here, it'd be great if you could update or reply to your own question with the solution, in case someone had the same question later :)

Are you me?
I am sitting here playing minesweeper in excel.  It can and does do everything.

My conversations at work seem to center more on, "Yes, we *could* do that in Excel but it's only making life harder for ourselves to do so"
While that is super impressive, I do want to point out that it isn't playable.  Just in case other people don't feel like clicking on the link and reading the article.  Not that that ever happens on reddit.... ;)
I doubt this would be possible at a decent / playable framerate. I have tried coding similar things in the past, admittedly on workplace computers when bored and the refresh rate is awful for full screen type stuff.
Haha I have heard something like that. If you want an answer to something, post the wrong answer so someone will correct you.
That would be the opposite of my teacher weirdly enough. He taught me how to define a problem and set out to solve it. Hardly used my book actually because he was so good at explaining things in lecture. 
It is really hard to describe a problem as well. Even harder to describe it to a search engine. 
God no.  Subs got to shit when they become defaults.
ðŸ˜… aww shucks ðŸ’š
Just wait til someone gets to 15,000 ClippyPoints. Then you'll *really* see something special on the scoreboard. 
Yep that's me - I've been doing Facebook live casts lately on the business page to kind of get past the long periods between blog posts: https://www.facebook.com/itsnotaboutthecell - and hopefully in due time I can get something going with the guys over at Excel TV: https://excel.tv/blogging-buddies-meet-alex-of-its-not-about-the-cell/
Are you triggered?
Are you attempting to knock Mr Excel???

Microsoft puns are my favorite office jokes
Thanks for the clarification. I've seen this mentioned several times, but only skimmed the article each time.
Oh no I was joking of course.  Sorry if it didn't come off right :)
I'll throw in for their Clippy costume.
Unless they get bored first I assume /u/rnelsonee will be the first one to make it there
i just made everyone at my job smarter because of that website, i know it says not to tell my boss, but we are a close group and this has opened up new projects for me to test.... thank you so much


ya
Are you attempting to be a shitty troll?
Damnit I'm too late to post this!!
Outlook, subreddits all other!
I was driven by envy induced rage.  I can conceive of an implementation for stop motion.  I would be lost trying to make it playable though.  Actually....  Well, maybe not lost....  Hmmm.  No, no, I have enough projects.
No worries.  It's the internet and sometimes I misread things.
Haha, you can tell which days are slow at work based on my r/excel posting. But I don't care about ClippyPoints, I just like solving problems. This sub is like a trivia quiz, except you try to actually help solve people's problems.
I noticed several of the articles were getting views today.... it all makes sense now - REDDIT!! lol...  It's honestly great to hear that you have a group in which to try out these ideas and concepts with and that this hopefully leads to more opportunities for yourself as well. I'm not much of a content machine but hopefully what I have amassed thus far is enough to get everyone thinking and that you continue to check back in over time.

As a side - there's some easter eggs littered throughout the site... good luck on your hunt!

[Missed Connections](http://itsnotaboutthecell.com/2016/06/20/missed-connections/) for instance uses the Craigslist personals format with a post id: 6988676976

    =CHAR(69)&CHAR(88)&CHAR(67)&CHAR(69)&CHAR(76)
Oh you are right fuck Mr Excel they are not helpful they are the worst just a bunch of losers only reddit excel is the best place for help I only come here because the people here are definitely not losers

Is that what you want?
That never happens.
i personally went through it thrice, each article... some of my coworkers in France and my finance team in CHI/NY have already gone through it.. there is one visible confusion i occurred, I believe the last article has a link at the end "not for the fainthearted or whatever", click this lesson, and it links to the 2nd to last one... still a very awesome website and the quotes motivated me :) 
Yeah the websites order is wonky - I would basically recommend reading them from the bottom to the top. But then new articles would be on the bottom so people would never know what's new vs. old.. blah blah blah.. I'll work towards putting together a page for how I would recommend reading through them. Once again thank you so much for reading and sharing with coworkers.
