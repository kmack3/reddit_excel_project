A THANK YOU to /r/excel contributors.
I second OP on this.  This sub is full of contributors whose goal is to teach and be taught.  I have never seen any squabble's here, and I think that is a testament to the, I guess I would call it, professionalism of these contributors.  I enjoy reading questions and responses just to pick up new things.  With all the talented contributors, there is always something new to learn here.
As a mod - I love you guys too!

The sub has become so much more sophisticated and a lot larger in the last year - however the level of awesomeness and professionalism has constantly remained awe-inspiring.

Thank you guys!
Well allow me to engage in your first squabble.  Vlookups are irrelevant and Index Match is far supperior.  

In all seriousness, you're correct the subscribers to this sub are generally very professional and courteous.  
Whoa whoa whoa.

Use my XLOOKUP UDF instead xD
What? Index Match??  Nah, use SUMIFS!
I actually completely agree about index/match. I find myself using vlookups on the fly, I just can't seem to shake it. They're like another part of me.
