Fairly new to excel. Can I use it to calculate physics equations?
You would put your values in respective cells and then have another cell, let's say A4 with the formula. Put G in another cell, let's say B1. I'd suggest using the $ preceding the column and row numbers in case you do some fill down work.

    Formula: A4 = ($B$1*$A$1*$A$2)/($A$3^2)

Edit: reddit formatting was screwing up my formula. I wasn't typing enough spaces (4 required) to override the formatting. Here's a screenshot of the actual characters: http://i.imgur.com/QszGMU5.png
You can define names in excel. Go to the "formula" section and see the "name manager." You can assign a1 to be "G" or just define it as a constant. You can't enter in "m1" but you could label it "Mass1."
Excel can do anything you want in Physics once you learn how to program in Visual Basic in Excel.

Stay with Excel, learn how to program with it, when you get out of college and into a job (most likely higher paying desk work for you with your interest in physics and math) you can impress the hell out of your boss by being able to ANALYZE data.

Excellent site for this sort of thing.
A better program for this use case would be [Calca](http://calca.io)
Eureka!

That's pretty easy. Thanks so much!

Came here to mention the name manager. Hey OP look over here and listen to this guy. This will be your best friend.
Has an iPhone app, nice. I'll have to check it out. Seems a little hard to use since it's a text editor, but I can probably figure it out.
FYI, reply to me with "Solution verified" to make the post change to solved.

Done. Thanks.
