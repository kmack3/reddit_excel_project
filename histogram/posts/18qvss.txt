Harlem Shake - Excel Style
I just sent this out to the entire Excel engineering team here at MSFT...awesome :)

Well done! Have not seen the spiral graph depicted in the lower left side of the screen before, I have some more Excel spelunking to do.
Nice! :D
That does not look *at all* like the type of graphs I do.
What the heck is the Harlem Shake?    It seems to be everywhere all of a sudden, and googling it just brought up a rapper from the 90s?
The Harlem Shake is a [dance move.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_cO0Y6jJoA) The latest trend in youtube videos is based on a song called [Harlem Shake](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV0LHCHf-pE). This genre of music is called Trap. Shameless plug for /r/trap.
