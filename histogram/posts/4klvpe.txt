These tiles stressed me out
I know goddammit that it's inconsistent. Leave me alone bill!
I could not live in this house.
Either that or the number in the tiles are formatted as text, or preceded by an apostrophe.

I feel like a nerd for laughing at this. Oh wells, I now have a new WhatsApp profile picture.
the worst is when one of them *isn't* flagged
Cover it with a 2 Variable table.
Or preceded by a no-space-blank character that does not render within the excel engine, but does exist in the text field.

That one was fun (sarcasm) to find via notepad++ editing of the excel file.
Good idea. I wonder if I'd ever regret turning off the notifications. I think not...
=code(left(A1,1)) will tell you what its character code is. - you can then use substitute(a1,char(code(left(A1,1))),"") to remove it. 
Probably, it will look like this:

> =TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(A4,CHAR(160),CHAR(32)))
