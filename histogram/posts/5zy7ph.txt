How do I stop VBA automatically changing a number range to a date (i.e. "12-16" to "16-Dec")?
Use this before setting a value to the cell:

    wks.Range(Cells(CurrentStartRow, X), Cells(CurrentEndRow, X)).NumberFormat = "@"
If you know the value should be text, instead of doing .value = .value, use .formula = "'" & .value

This should change "12-16" to "'12-16" which Excel will accept as a string value on the front end.
I also always make sure all of my "interval" values always start with an apostrophe 

the problem with that solution is sometimes I want the format to be a number depending on which column its copying.  My solution right now is just to change the format of everything in the column beneath the formula cell to Text
Perhaps you could use a select case switch statement to determine which number format to use based on the column number?
