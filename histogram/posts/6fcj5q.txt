Lines are being created in Excel
What do you mean by lines?

Do you mean break a cell into more cells?


Maybe insert a text box within the merged cell and copy a table from word into it? I think youre trying to make a table inside of a cell.
If it's merged then unmerge it and apply the lines.
Yeah. So the cell has been pre-wrapped but i want to create lines within that wrapped cell. However, even if i try to 'draw' the line in, it won't let me.

Doesn't work. I highlight the cell and click unmerge but nothing happens
You are new to Excel I take it.

This is a bad idea. I Would suggest you redesign and work within the cells provided. Data loves being on its own and not sharing cells. Data is read and analysed and totalled far more easily when in its own cell.

That's only one cell. You can only draw borders around a cell, as far as I know.
