Who is your favorite Excel Guru?
YouTube Channel ExcelIsFun. Mike "ExcelIsFun" Girvin has over 2,000 video tutorials covering every topic you could imagine. 

He also has a site to download the corresponding workbooks to follow along. I have 2 of his books and love them. I recommend him to everyone who asks me how they can improve their Excel skills
[Chandoo](http://chandoo.org/) is a pretty chill guy. I like his podcasts, and his website lays out ideas and how to use functions etc. very clearly.
[John Walkenbach](http://spreadsheetpage.com/)


[Chip Pearson](http://www.cpearson.com). His VBA insight and accessibility allowed me to grasp the majority of concepts of VB (and programming/coding in general). If VBA is drugs, he's definitely the best dealer in town, though it then makes VBA worse than meth (when compared to other languages) ;D
The people that moderates this sub. 
Jon Peltier over at the [Peltier Tech Blog](http://peltiertech.com). When googling various techniques or tips, I invariably wind up there or on chandoo or Chip Pearson.
[Ron de Bruin](http://www.rondebruin.nl/) and [Chip Pearson](http://http://www.cpearson.com/) - Much of the VBA I have learned is from their forum posts and websites. 
Epicmindwarp knows his shit.
Hector Miguel

This guy have been replying questions about excel in Spanish forums since... well since I was a Kid. I learn everything I know about Excel from him.

My favorite guru is Daniel Ferry. His work is breathtaking, and pushes the limit of what I thought was possible. Here's what I believe to be his finest work, a piece he calls "Celtic Muse"

If you're running a 64 bit computer I wouldn't bother trying the workbook, and instead simply go with the flash video there.
Chandoo.org has had some good resources
I owe a great deal of my excel knowledge to Mike's videos, he's a great teacher
He's also taught me to be a better teacher. He explains things so clearly, that u have a much better grasp of how to teach a concept.
I like Chandoo a lot, his website is one of the most personal excel sites I've seen, followed closely by The Spreadsheet Page and Bacon Bits. His articles are very visual and easy to follow, and easily the best resource for dynamic/interactive charting & dashboarding.
In terms of book production, it's J-Walk and Bill Jelen who are the undeniable champions. And J-Walk's books on VBA programming (the one for dummies and power programming) are masterpieces of simplicity when it comes to conveying knowledge.
I like Chip Pearson too, he's got a very no-nonsense approach that's helpful when you get to the level of skill he's catering to.
We love our users too! You guys are the ones that make this place shine!
