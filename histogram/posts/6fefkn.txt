VBA: Get date from second visible row after autofilters using offset
I'm not sure that I'm following your range reference. Anyways I wrote this alternate code. It takes a Range argument instead of a column letter, and also lets you select any number for X. It assumes you include the header in the range.

    Private Function GetVisible(rng As Range, x As Integer) As String
    
        Dim Cell As Range
        VisibleCount = 0
        
        For Each Cell In Range(rng.Offset(1, 0), rng.End(xlDown))
            If Cell.EntireRow.Hidden = False Then
                GetVisible = Cell.Value2
                VisibleCount = VisibleCount + 1
            End If
            If VisibleCount = x Then Exit For
        Next Cell
    End Function
Getting an app/object defined error (1004) on line 6 (from your snippit above, it is line 12 on mine below).

Also - assuming VisibleCount should be dim as integer.

Here's the modified version I'm trying to test right now:

    Sub DumbSub()
        MsgBox GetVisible(ActiveWorkbook.Sheets("ReportsRaw").Range("G:G"), 1)
    End Sub

    Private Function GetVisible(rng As Range, x As Integer) As String        
        Dim Cell As Range
        Dim VisibleCount As Integer
        
        VisibleCount = 0
    
        For Each Cell In Range(rng.Offset(1, 0), rng.End(xlDown))
            If Cell.EntireRow.Hidden = False Then
                GetVisible = Cell.Value2
                VisibleCount = VisibleCount + 1
            End If
            If VisibleCount = x Then Exit For
        Next Cell
    End Function


Needs a small change to be able to accommodate passing an entire column. 

    Private Function GetVisible(rng As Range, x As Integer) As String
    
        Dim Cell As Range
        VisibleCount = 0
        
        MsgBox rng.Cells(2, 1).Address
        MsgBox rng.End(xlDown).Address
        
        For Each Cell In Range(rng.Cells(2, 1), rng.End(xlDown))
            If Cell.EntireRow.Hidden = False Then
                GetVisible = Cell.Value2
                VisibleCount = VisibleCount + 1
            End If
            If VisibleCount = x Then Exit For
        Next Cell
    End Function

Awesome.  Thanks for saving my ass twice in one week.  There is only so much Googling I can do before going insane.
