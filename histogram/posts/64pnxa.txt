Testing Excel skills
I did this one once. Gave some insight, but nothing official. http://www.auditexcel.co.za/excel-skills-assessment/

I think /u/epicmindwarp did one. He's the guy to ask if you have questions.
That's a pretty shitty excel test.  What was with the last question asking which of the functions go together?  You can literally use any of them together in the same formula.
To be fair I find it a bit trivial, it asks for oddly specific things or proposes ambiguous situations. Was still fun to do though.
Thank you, it's nice!
Please post if he has one or gives you a recommendation.
