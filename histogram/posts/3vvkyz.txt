Excel Date Picker Add-in
Nice work! I will try it out.
Great work Sam.
Nice, clear calendar that just "works" out of the box with no problems.
I will certainly make use of this.
There's already one provided in standard Excel (although requires you to enable it):

thanks!
Thanks Roger!
True! Though not with standard Excel afaik. You need the [comctrl32 installed](http://danielcurran.com/instructions/how-to-install-microsoft-date-time-picker-control-60-sp4/) which some folks don't have since its an optional activex set of controls ... but not hard to get. Though different than the add-in I made since in the article you link to you have to build it to update cells for each cell or sheet. My add-in works on dates in all of the workbooks loaded without needing to add it to the sheet.

edit: grammar
Yeah some good work you've done there regardless ;-)
Thanks! Part of the fun of Excel: making things :-)
