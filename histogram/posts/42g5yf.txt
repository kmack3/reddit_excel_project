CMV: Excel for Mac is always going to be behind in performance and features, and anyone doing advanced/demanding work in Excel on a Mac should run Excel in Parallels, Fusion, or a similar emulator

>At this point, I'm considering ditching Excel for Mac (2016) and simply going the Parallels route, but I'm hoping someone can change my view on this or give me some hope/advice that makes the experience more manageable.

Do it, trust me your life will be easier. The mac application is far behind the windows version 
Might also want to vote for 64-bit support [here](http://excel.uservoice.com/forums/304933-excel-for-mac/filters/top)
Excel for the Mac is absolute garbage. Please save ur self the stress and frustration.
I had to give up and get a Windows computer. :(
Really it's much better to boot directly into Windows n
I'm fairly sure that Microsoft doesn't put much effort in making Excel for Mac as user friendly or powerful as its Windows counterpart. It's like asking Coke to make a product similar in taste to Pepsi so that its customers will make the jump to the real thing. 
What about Numbers? Do you really need VBA?
I think parallels has an option where you could load into a separate windows partition or boot directly if you want a better and probably faster experience
VBA is a versatile workhorse in the world of spreadsheets
Numbers is like using a child's plastic tricycle to commute an hour to work for anything outside of household use.
Unless I'm missing something—and I'll gladly admit to not knowing too much about Numbers—there isn't really any advanced conditional formatting in Numbers. Also, it seems that variables in formulas awkwardly "lock" into the names of the columns, making complex equations nearly impossible to simply visualize.
>Do you really need VBA?

Yes.
Latest Numbers re-adds Applescript support. Excel import kinda works but I don't deal with VBA to know how broken it is.
