New Excel Survey from Microsoft
Mechanical engineer here;
After this survey I feel like my whole excel experience is like the forbidden city in china.
I do engineering work within Excel, like calculations of stresses and converting design data for my calculations. however none of the questions or stuff I find on the web can realy relate to the engineering workfield. 
Do other engineers have this problem as well? 
I'm an Accountant for an insurance agency. None of this applies to me.

Why can't we discuss VBA and future functionality? Why isn't the VBA editor being improved from version to version? There was talk MSFT would incorporate Python into the VBA libraries. Is that still planned?
They probably just want to know which professions they need to market certain features to. That's all the survey was.
In the last AMA that we helped conduct, the Excel team said that VBA is an item on their development list. But they also emphasised on moving on to more comprehensive languages like Javascript or maybe even Python.

They addressed this question many times in the AMA, this is one such reply. https://m.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3rid26/we_are_the_microsoft_excel_team_ask_us_anything/

You can read their other responses in the thread too, it's  interesting read for an Excel enthusiast.
