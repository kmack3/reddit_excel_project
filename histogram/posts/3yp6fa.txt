Thank you to this amazing community!
Anything the mod team can do to make this sub EVEN better?
I agree a million percent. You guys have saved my ass at work a few times. 
Flair set to discussion, let's keep the sub tidy ;)

(Also, stickied this) =)
In my opinion this is the best sub on reddit (granted I don't go to many other sites).

Everyone here is generally extremely helpful and patient.
As a long time idler (who keeps forgetting his account details and so has probably made four different accounts to ask questions on here) I'd like to chime in and agree with you.

This subreddit is directly responsible for a large chunk of my salary growth in the last year and given that I've had to re-locate my wife and disabled daughter in said year, those promotions and results were an absolute life saver financially.

Hard work + creativity + this sub = is a surefire formula for success and I am referring my co-workers and employees to this subreddit on a weekly basis.

Thank you all for being amazing, when I'm a proper Excel wizard in a couple of years I'll do my best to repay the community and hoard clippy points of my own ;)
>You all have really helped me with making my work better and more organized

I love this! My belief is putting in the time and effort to learn how Excel can enrich productivity will be rewarded. It looks like it's working for you! It definitely worked for me, and that's one of the reasons I contribute here. 
I just want to add too that this place is awesome.

Seriously, working on Excel is so satisfying, sense of achievement when your vba or formulas just work perfectly. Specially on things that would take hours to do manually take seconds. Only frustrating thing is not knowing exactly how to do something, knowing it's possible, haha.
my bad! Thank you based mod

No worries, thank you for the kind words =D
