Copied code from one spreadsheet to another but can't get results to duplicate.
Do you have dates in X1:EZ1 and then the numbers "1", "2", and "3" in X2:EZ2?  

The formula you have is searching the row X2:EZ2 for the first cell that contains with a "1", "2", or "3" and returns whatever is above that cell in Row 1.

It's also looking for 1, 2, and 3 as strings, not as integers. You should remove the quotation marks around the 1, 2, and 3 if they're just in there are numbers (they presumably are), i.e. `match(1,$X2:$EZ2, 0)`
I don't have 1, 2, or 3 in every cell, only the ones where it is relevant, but I don't think that would be an issue, correct? 

Actually looking more closely, x1:EZ1 show up as dates but the cells themselves have the following code: 

=if(weekday(ET$1, 2)<5, ET$1+1, ET$1+3)

That is the code for cell EU1. 
Correct, formula is just looking for the first time it sees a 1, 2, 3. Will ignore any other value. Having formulas in row 1 is not an issue. I think removing the quotation marks will solve your problem.
Just tried that - If I keep the ones around 1, 2, 3 and remove only the ones at the end I still get a blank box. When I removed them from only around 1, 2, 3, and from all parts, I ended up with "42772" in the cell? No idea where that's coming from. 
You can keep the "" at the end, I'm saying just remove the "" around 1, 2, and 3.   

`=iferror(index($X$1:$EZ$1, 1, min(iferror(match(1,$X2:$EZ2, 0),300), iferror(match(2,$X2:$EZ2, 0), 300), iferror(match(3,$X2:$EZ2, 0),300))),"")`

42772 is a date. Just right click the cell and change the number format to "Date"
