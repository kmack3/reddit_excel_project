Copy/paste, not copying over the cells format.
[deleted]
Without actually seeing what is going on, just general recommendations from me:

* Do try paste special. It can be efficient if you learn the keys: `Ctrl+Alt+v v` for values. 
* Do not use merged cells. Use _center across selection_ for horizontal formatting that looks just like merged cells, but behaves better.
Any help besides the most vague questions ever given are appreciated.
Do you have a link or something to an example of this in use?
I'm not really understanding too well the example, but for now I'm just going to show an example of what I have and what info I'd put in the table

To show my problem: the same things I copied as of now, if I paste them ( in a new customers spreadsheet) it'll come out like this. [using clipboard](http://i.imgur.com/JDilBCD.jpg)


Of course I'm open to learn another way and try to understand your example more if it'll help me in the long run. I showed this just for s temporary  fix and just give you an idea of what my end looks like and some things that change.
To the left in the clipboard is what I want it to look like, when I paste this is what it comes out as instead. 
Before, it would come out exactly like what's in the clipboard

I just do them in whatever order because I have to print it and take it to whichever store
