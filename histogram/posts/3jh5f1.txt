Best online course for Excel 2013?
If you are unemployed through no fault of your own, and/or on unemployment check out potential for State Grants on the Obama get back to work program (or something like that.) When my company let go a bunch of employees tons of us went to a school and got certifications from NET+ A+, CISP, PMP, CAPM, MSDN (or similar for each MS program) certifications (which is what you are looking for) these were all provided free with the Grant. 
Thanks for the help everyone. I'm actually looking at the moment.

10 dollars for the essentials course and then again for the expert course. Seems to have all I need and I get a certificate at the end. Employers love that shit.
I think /u/myfapaccount_istaken's comment made this thread worth allowing. 
suggest you check the [Sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2e28s3/rexcel_advice_thread_repository/)


In a more casual setting I suggest http://excelexposure.com/ also which I have found extremely helpful in the past.

Have a look at courses on Udemy, big sale offering loads of courses for Â£8 at the moment.
Normally I would delete these type of "looking to learn" posts as we have a huge sticky - and you're told 3 times before you post to read the damned side-bar, but I'm going to let this one stay - as it is *only just* different to what we currently have in the sticky.

However, if nothing new appears from this post, then it will be deleted.
Can you give some further information here? Would love to see how to get certified for Excel by the state.
Try filtered.com and sample the course before subscribing. It's used by various companies in the UK, and it also removes modules not related to your everyday excel tasks based off a survey you take. 
Aww g thanks.  
Ohw life is repetition to you it seems, but as a looking for the best (not cheap, not free or something else) course to take it seems nobody had the real answer. The office training center are the basics, some course ask a huge amount and not all of "us" have Obama as a president. Your probably an America or English noticing the light bit of arrogance. I do thank the community for all the assistance, but the so called "veteran" i know it all because i am whoever really annoys the fuck out of me. 
It was grant through workforce central Florida  but iirc it was a Nation wide program.  The school new horizon did all the work for us abs expedite the process was well worth it. 
> Your probably an America or English

Nope, and nope.

Did the growing up in poverty thing just like everyone else.
I read a tired reaction of someone annoyed with  people, might be my day and then i am sorry. You really hit a nerve.
