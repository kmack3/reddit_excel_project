please don't upvote does anyone know where to get help on google sheets?
Which browser are you using? Is it up to date? Almost makes me think your graphics driver might need updating, too. It probably wouldn't hurt to x-post this to /r/techsupport either. They might be able to help as well.

Could you make the Sheet public, or copy, sanitize data, then make public? I'm curious to see if this is reproducible.
Have you tried Format - Clear Formatting yet?
My only issues with google sheets ended up being fixed when I reset the screen "zoom". Try hitting "control-zero". 
Hmm. I've been getting the same issues here. Interesting to know it's not just me
Don't tell me how to live my life.
Chrome and yes its up to date, graphic card is xfx 290a just bought and installed the latest as of a month ago.  
What are the parentheses after up vote and downvote for?
If this is happening on ONLY this one Google Doc, I'd say that it'd be worth trying to replicate.  But if this is happening on new documents right away, I don't think it'd be worth it.

If I were OP, I'd start with trying a different browser first.  If they have any other graphical issue other than this one, I'd lean towards a bad graphics card or driver.

Could also be a browser extension causing issues.  OP should try Incognito in Chrome and see if that fixes it
Hmm. Are other sheets doing it to or just this sheet in particular?
functions have parameters... you still have to pass them even if they are blank
I was just trying to make it look like a function, like =TODAY().
Fixed(kinda) tried in Mozilla and worked normal. Thanks guy everyone that put in their input. 
All sheets, I wen't as far as re-installing windows on it (computer 1.5 months old) it used to be a black box. But, its the same size square that just looks like a CIA file now. 
Did you try Chrome Incognito to rule out extension issues?
