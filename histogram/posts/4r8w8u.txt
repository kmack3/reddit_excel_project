What is the equivalent of "ExcelisFun" for Access?
I would be interested in knowing as well.  Struggled with databases for a long time, just generally designing one - choosing tables and relationships etc.  With my excel experience I kept ending up trying to build a spreadsheet in access which doesn't work properly and doesn't actually end up as a database.

My lightbulb moment was realising that the data tables in access aren't meant to be user viewable.  So trying to lay them out and have calculated fields and so on like with an excel table was causing problems.  The only way you should be looking at your data in a database is with queries etc, which would do the work of calculating the dynamic fields etc.
What OP needs is a copy of *SQL For Smarties.* It will make everything clear as glass.

And, the PDF version of this fantastic book can be found online with just a little bit of searching.

The book is Oracle based, but the laws are the laws. And the laws work regardless of the database platform.

Also, Access is not just a database. It is a software program that can create a database. And a program that can create detailed, multi-dimensional reports from a database. And a program that can produce user interfaces for a database. And it hosts it's own programming language - One that can spawn and/or interact with other desktop software and manipulate that software and data.

It's a lifetime career in a box, if you want it. Excel paid for my boat. Access paid for my house.

To be fair, IT will hate you for life, but the business will love you and pay you.

The Internet being what is is, you can make a six-figure income consulting with big companies, fixing Access problems.  Or creating new solutions.

I'm looking forward to how this post goes. My experience is real.

He has some amazing Access videos and some of the most creative Excel videos on the web. Highly recommend. But it won't be as comprehensive as ExcelIsFun.
Maybe ask Mike "excel is fun" guy on Twitter. He'd have some good recommendations
This is pretty good (for iPhone):

Microsoft has their online classes published ~~online~~ for free , it might be a good start? 
599CD Has some decent videos.

I've watched the VBA (Excel) playlist for 50% from this guy named YourProgrammingNetwork (https://www.youtube.com/user/Malfunction9) on YouTube.
I think his way of explaining works good and builds up nicely qua level of expertise needed.

He also has an playlist for Access. I think this is worth watching.

Also would love to see the answer to this!
> IT will hate you for life

I'm genuinely curious, but why is that? I've been an Access user for years and I never got the impression of being hated by IT. 
I had a look at a few of his videos, and I must say it's nice seeing someone using excel for scientific analysis instead of financial. Subscribed, thank you!
What's his Twitter?

Edit: never mind found it.
I scrubbed through a few, they seemed more geared towards office noobies (this is the ribbon, here's how you open a database etc.) 

The later ones might be better but I assumed that there would be a go to guy. Looks like I'm wrong.

That's a pretty steep paywall to get into if you want to get in the nitty gritty.
Access DB's are often developed by non-developers who don't know much, if anything, about database design.  They are also not documented and developed outside official processes.  They (IT) are often called in after the developer left and there is a problem and asked to solve the issue immediately.
Let us know his response. :)
They have a sort by level. Start with intermediate. Microsoft online learning Academy.
