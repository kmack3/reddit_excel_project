Best way to download multiple separate excel documents into one workbook?
If you have Excel for Windows 2010 or later, you can do this with Power Query, renamed in Excel 2016 as Get & Transform.

You can set up a dedicated folder and drop all 10 CSVs in it. Then use Get & Transform (Excel 2016) to import the data by pointing a query to the folder. It will import all files, and if you add new files later, you'd just have to refresh your query.


Here's an example of how to do it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjnFKS9iXPs
ASAP Utilities had a tool for this. 
Thanks for replying so quickly! I'm using 2013, by the way.

So, I found the option to get the data imported: on the data ribbon, 'from other sources', 'from Microsoft query'--but I'm having trouble figuring out how to connect my folder correctly, as I get the error 'this data source contains no visible tables'. What did I do wrong?


Power Query has it's own separate ribbon, and a set of options within for data import options. It sounds like you have not yet downloaded and installed Power Query ([link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379)).

FuschiaDevil is correct about Power Query being the best option for your request. Especially if you can download them as CSV.
Here's a quick video. I'm in a loud cafe otherwise I would have narrated instead of using the brief notes. I hope this helps. Let me know.

Thanks, and you're right, turns out I have no Power Query. This effort is on a work computer, and I was supposed to have had all the add-ones installed already, but it looks like they missed this one. I'll put in a ticket tomorrow. Now just to figure out how to deal with all that data...
