Hahah, that was pretty good
That. Was. Amazing. 
If that teacher had really cared about his students he'd have taught them Index Match instead of Vlookup. 
That was pretty good. However, I will retire if I ever get that excited about Excel. 
I wish I was tough this stuff in my college excel course. 

We learned some necessary functions and super basic VBA, but didn't cover any v/h lookups, index, etc.

We did learn Var and Varp though lol Super useful for all you non-stock traders.
Ah, this would be so much nicer if I hadn't heard the original song about 300 times. Still, polite golf clap for the video.
But, he also taught them AVERAGE, so that makes up for this minor oversight.
This is an entry level Excel course, IIRC. The kids need to know how to use VLookup because they will encounter it in the workplace. I believe Index/Match and other more "advanced" topics are covered in later courses.
I'm big fan of SUMIFS, haven't gotten as much into the INDEX+MATCH game yet though I know I should
Is there a special use for AVERAGE outside of getting the average of a data set?
