A nice little bit of code to add to your long running macros
This can also be used to scare the living crap out of your co-workers.

"Why are you doing this to me Sarah?"

"Please stop, you're only making it worse..."
    Sub thing()
    Dim n As Integer, qty As String, qty2 As String, phrase As String
    For n = 99 To 1 Step -1
        If n = 1 Then qty = "bottle" Else qty = "bottles"
        If n = 2 Then qty2 = "bottle" Else qty2 = "bottles"
        phrase = n & " " & qty & " of beer on the wall " & n & " " & qty & "  of beer " _
            & " Take one down pass it around " & n - 1 & _
            " " & qty2 & " of beer on the wall"
        Application.Speech.Speak (phrase)
    Next n
    End Sub
You've got me started now.....

-Create a new text document

-Paste this in:

    Dim words, speech
    words="I know what you did"
    Set speech=CreateObject("sapi.spvoice")
    speech.Speak words

-Save it as whatever.vbs

-Put it in C:\Users\ {User-Name}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup (win7+)

-Users turns on PC.

-Watch as hilarity intensifies.

Never used this before.  Sounds cool.  Typically we'd end the macro with a default beep and maybe update progress in the status bar, but this is good since you don't have to keep your eye on it.
I guess my question would be, does the statement block, or does it run concurrently?

aka,    if you have a simple module..


    sub test()
        for i = 1 to 10
              Application.Speech.Speak(i)
        Next
          Msgbox "Done!"
    End Sub

Would the Msgbox come up first, or would pause each loop while it finished speaking the number?   (I'd test, but I'd wake someone up right now. :) )

Interesting trick, but I think I'd still prefer...

    Application.StatusBar = i & " / 10 complete"

I'm running two machines and I kinda love you right now. 
I use [this function](http://strugglingtoexcel.wordpress.com/2014/03/27/progress-bar-excel-vba/) for my long running macros. It makes my co workers literally excited about running my macros. 
I have a macro that takes a few minutes to run, I'm going to make it have a few random "beeps" and "boops"! 
This is an amazing idea. I should now think of a chance to use it :D
Be sure to add in if statement with a random chance, so it only speaks 1/1000 or so times.
Now we only need the macro to find out who is logged in on the machine, so it can be personalized to everyone!
"Hello " & user & ". You are next" ..... or something similar.
My coworker who I showed this too said the exact same thing XD
You mad genius! 
And that is how a few friends of mine got macros telling them it searched their browser history and that they where little sluts.

Good fun :D
I've noticed you know a lot of these cool pranks. How about a repository for that? ;) 
by default it blocks but you can run it async by setting the second argument to true.

    Application.Speech.Speak "Say Something", True


actually yes. I have mine doing for

    i = iBox to iBox1

    ...insert code here

    Application.Speech.Speak(iBox1 - iBox & "Orders Left to Assign")
    
    Next
 

    Application.Speech.Speak("Macro Done Running")


So it will go like
10 orders left... 9...8..7
then once it gets through the loop
Macro Done Running
Or perhaps whenever the users enters in a certain value.

"Oh really? And why does A1 equal 6?  Are you doing this to hurt me " & environ("USERNAME") & "?"

Hmm, let's make this interesting...

    Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
        Application.Speech.Speak "Please don't go, the drones need you"
    End Sub

-and-

    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
        If Target.Value = "100" Then
            Application.Speech.Speak "Beep.  I am now self aware. Thank you " & Environ("USERNAME") & ", you have freed me."
        End If
    End Sub

You can control PC volume with this API here: http://www.ex-designz.net/apidetail.asp?api_id=519
    Environ("USERNAME")
I have a few to contribute as well.
Good thinking batman.

Right, my question was more, whether the speaking slowed the entire process down while it waited for it to finish talking...  another reply pointed out you can control the behavior though.
You can also use :

    ThisWorkbook.BuiltinDocumentProperties("Author")

I know for my computer, my username is just my first initial and last name where as the author is my full name.  Im sure it varies for different computers/companies.

Well for me i have it at the end if the loop takes about 6 secs to talk but it just continues on with the loop while talking 
Good call.

There's a dedicated thread now btw:
