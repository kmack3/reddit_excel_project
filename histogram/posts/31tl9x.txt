I got this course when it was free. Retail is quite expensive, but it was a very good course. I am proficient in VBA because of it.
Foundation wise, slaying excel dragons the series ob youtube was what gave me the foundation to become the "excel wizard" at my work place. Sometimes. .. a lot of the times its simple foundational things that give people the hardest time.
I've found excell's youtube and thier own support very awesome, as well as user videos.  I've never taken any structured lessons, so maybe not what you're looking for, but when ever I've wanted to learn how to do something most of the time I can find it on youtube.  I've only had to ask a question here once.
Google... the best ever! ;)
As someone who is completely average with excel and planning this summer to master it the best I can, do you think this is my best bet for $10?

Wondering the same thing...
I do think it is a very good one. 

I also am taking this free one that if you sign up soon you can get into. It is a graded course and has a college curriculum. https://openeducation.blackboard.com/mooc-catalog/courseDetails/view?course_id=_219_1
