Transform number string into date
Where A1 is the date, `=DATE(20&RIGHT(A1,2),LEFT(RIGHT(A1,4),2),LEFT(A1,1+(LEN(A1)=6)))`

We have to add 20 to the year to return the current millenia,

for the day part, if len is 5 return 0 if len is 6 return 1, so len is 1+0 or 1+1 for return length

the Len portion returns 0 or 1 where true or false
Do you need this one time or do you need this to continue to add data?
If you only need it one time I would try something similar to your last option and then copy the column, paste as values, and see if you can format it as a date. 
If you need it to constantly update for new data I think I'm stumped.  I would probably start by searching for a text string column of dates and creating a lookup table. 
    =DATE(20&RIGHT(A1,2),IF(LEN(A1)=6,MID(A1,3,2),MID(A1,2,2)),IF(LEN(A1)=6,LEFT(A1,2),LEFT(A1,1)))

does this work for you?

thank you so much, I was now at 90% correct formula with the following

=IF(LEN(B4)=4,DATEVALUE(LEFT(B4,1)&"/"&MID(B4,2,1)&"/"&MID(B4,3,2)),IF(LEN(B4)=6,DATEVALUE(LEFT(B4,2)&"/"&MID(B4,3,2)&"/"&MID(B4,5,2)),IF(LEFT(B4,2)="0",DATEVALUE(LEFT(B4,2)&"/"&MID(B4,3,1)&"/"&MID(B4,4,2)),DATEVALUE(LEFT(B4,2)&"/"&MID(B4,3,1)&"/"&MID(B4,4,2)))))


but yours is much more simple.
