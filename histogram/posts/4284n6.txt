Microsoft Data Insight Summit - March 22-23
Is there anything like this on the east coast? 
Will this be recorded? If not,  would someone mind assisting an 'iPad facetime attached to a segway' version of me for this? 
And for anyone residing in the opposite region of the world, there's also [Excel Summit South](https://excelsummitsouth.wordpress.com/) that same month.
can you fly me in?? pretty please!
Sold out :(
Or will there be webinars available?
