Automatically Generate Astrological Sign Based On Birthday
I would find a table that had date=> sign online and put it in a tab then in the sign column do =Vlookup(b2,sheet2!a:sheet2!b,falseï¼‰
Create two columns. One with the astrological sign and next to it have the last possible date that sign applies to. For example (note I don't know the actual date) if Leo is 7/2 to 8/20 then in column 1 you'd have leo and in column 2 on the same row you'd have 8/20 not 7/2. Then you could do a vlookup with an approximate match
That did not work. I used the below V-Lookup statement and received #N/A as the error. I need a year to put at the end of each date for the astrological sign so Excel can read it in the date format. I even used the Define Name feature and named the range of signs and dates Astrological Signs in the hope it would resolve any issue, but it did not. Is there a specific year and specific V-Lookup statement I am to use?

=VLOOKUP(B2,AstrologicalSigns,2,TRUE)
Well your lookup value needs to match your data value.

So if you try to lookup "05/01" but your lookup table has "05/01/2017" you'll get that #N/A

I would do something like this, utilizing date ranges and testing to see if X date is between the upper and lower bounds of each sign 

    Lets C1 has John Smith birthday, and F1 has the first date of the sign, G1 has the last date of the sign, and H1 has the sign name itself.

    =IF(AND (C1>=F1, C1 <=G1), H1, IF(AND(C1>=F2,C1 <=G2, H2.....
