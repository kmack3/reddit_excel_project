On the Fly Data Validation (Picklist)
Nifty little trick, if you prefer typing you can always just do that, but I thought it was useful enough to share.  
I learned this just a few days ago by accident! It also works on the menu of a table with filters. I hate using my mouse if I don't have to! 
This is pretty awesome.
That is amazing.  Thanks!  Also, I like your gifs. 
Thanks! Doing the lords work etc. Keep it up! :)
One advantage is it sorts in alphabetical order, so can be used as a quick check for duplicates as well.  Doesn't appear to work for numbers.
