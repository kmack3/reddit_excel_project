Crtl + Backspace will take you to the top of a range selection while keeping the range selected
If you've got a range selected, control and full stop will change the selections starting point (ie it will cycle the corners) 

Tres useful
Ah that is genius and going to be very useful to me! My previous method was to use scroll lock and then ctrl+arrow keys to get to the other end of a selected range without resorting to mouse use.  I do this quite commonly. 


Incidentally, I don't think I've ever found another use for scroll lock 
Ahhhhh wonderful! Another keyboard shortcut that will save seconds many times throughout the day. It all adds up! Thank you for sharing! 
Is this the same as ctrl+shift+arrow? With that one there's no chance of deleting anything.
You're a lifesaver man, appreciate it and Merry Christmas =) 
That's a great pro tip, gonna be very useful! Thanks :D

Try ctrl + home/end
I find those useful
very handy.  What I've been doing for years is applying formatting, like 'no fill', which keeps your selection and takes you to the top.
Well this was an early christmas present!
muchos!!

Full stop?
Damn, an Excel thing I didn't know that's actually helpful.

It's a Christmas miracle!
WHAT
Did not know this. I use Ctrl + Space to select columns now and it's a huge timesaver. 
AAAAAH THANK YOU
This is my question as well. 
With ctrl-shift-arrow you don't maintain the selection, do you?
It's a Chanukah present... 
Ctrl + .
Period for us Yanks
Yeah you do, the shift allows you to maintain the selection.
But if you are already selecting an area and then go to the bottom with ctrl-shft-arrow (down) then ctrl-shift-up unselects it.  Using ctrl-backspace keeps it selected.
Oh my. I see! My mistake, this is indeed helpful!
Yeah, I had to try it out to see.  I've been using excel for a long time too!
