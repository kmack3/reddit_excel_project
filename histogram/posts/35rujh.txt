Are any of you Excel wizards in Houston and looking for work?
Well, I'm not in Texas, but I know at least a couple of our regular contributors are down in the vicinity.   More information would probably help people know if they'd be interested.

* 1099 / W-2?
* Contract to hire, or just Contract?
* Duration?
* Target rate?
* Relocation? / Remote?  (Wouldn't be the first time I was 100% remote.)

Then there's the "biggie"... when you say "advanced", are you talking about "Knows how to sum using a hotkey", or "Knows how to build userforms and import and analyze data from external data sources using nothing more than VBA and chewing gum?

Keeping in mind is a sub of data crunchers, being coy probably won't get you far. :)
Not in Houston, but I used to be. I miss the restaurants. 

Back in the early 90s, when my wife was a stat major and I was a physics major at Rice U, my wife was approached by an older business student in her stat classes to help him develop an Excel spreadsheet suite for sale to a Russian petrochemical company. It was the era of Glasnost, pardner.

She helped him out -- mostly laying out the input fields and formulas on the Mac, he would open them on the PC and check them before sending them off. 

I ran into him like 7 years later and reminded him that my wife was the one who helped him build those spreadsheets, and he tells me they were still using them and asking him support questions.
Crosspost to /r/eve it's essentially spreadsheets online.
In Houston, I sent you a PM.
Why should the service provider be in Houston? I am in Houston, and my Excel mentor is in Dallas. Didn't stop me from picking up cool Excel tricks.

Your real requirement is what should define your search. eg. Somebody who can analyze data and design solutions vs somebody who knows tool XYZ version 2016. I earn my daily crust fixing stuff made by people who "know tool XYZ version 2016".
I'm Not in Houston, but I would love too. I have  excel expertise, eng. graduation and experience in oil and gas. Looking forward to receive a PM from you ðŸ˜€
So things like this actually pan out? Seems like a scetch place to search for someone to work for you. This website can be completely anonymous if you use it that way and it's discouraged to share contact info.

I could totally see having someone help you out on little projects remotely here and there for bitcoin, yet even that is tricky due to the confidential nature of most analyst work.  (I actually think a lot of the free "here's how to analyze your data" given on this sub people should charge bitcoin for, I guess I'm less community oriented when it comes to the skill that is my bread and butter. Little tips, shortcuts and discussion obviously would be free.)

Is there really that much of a shortage of Excel experts in Houston? 

I would approach this differently.  I'd post a link to the job advert, separate myself entirely and let people who are interested apply. You could encourage them to say they saw out on /r/excel.
> using nothing more than VBA and chewing gum

AKA the MacGyvers of Excel
We are looking for a 1099 contract, hopefully contract to hire. My company is a firm believer that when you find a good employee, you find a way to make them happy for the long haul. Unfortunately we are not super into a total remote situation as we would prefer to have someone in-house to learn exactly what we do and the logistics of the process, then help us find a solution for our issues. As far as my definition of "advanced", I mean something closer to your second definition lol. 
Cute little side story.. Wasn't expecting that..
It is amazing how long people will hold onto something that works and was well thought out.  I was shocked when  a company I worked for more than 13 years ago asked me for the password for one of the excel sheets I made.  The funny thing is, she had been staring at the password every day for 13 years right next to the button she was clicking to run everything, as it was a password to avoid accidental edits more than anything.
A quick glance over there left me confused...

When you say "like spreadsheets online" I would have thought you were talking about google sheets.
fellow Eve'er here checking in, can confirm
[removed]
My boss wants someone who can be in-house with us for a bit of time to learn exactly what it is we're doing and the logistics of the process. It's likely that our current method is not the best one to suit out needs and he would like for someone to swoop in and save the day. 
I sent you a PM :)
Why wouldn't this pan out? Just PM candidates the mailaddress they can send their CV to and you can treat it like any other application, except that you can maybe look into their post history to see if they are indeed proficient in Excel. I think it's rather smart really.
Regarding your bit about being "community oriented", yeah... if I find a problem interesting, I'll work on it for an hour or so, because it might be useful to have under my belt later.

I've gotten a few offers through helping people in this sub, but none that I felt were legitimate enough to follow up on.

>Is there really that much of a shortage of Excel experts in Houston? 

At the rate they're probably willing to pay for what I suspect is short-term contact work?  Yeah, likely.   It's probably a small company with no budget for recruiting, or contract houses, looking for someone they can pay a pittance to in order to be some well below-market assistance.

However, I am trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.

Thanks for your input and suggestions, but I know how to reddit. 
Excel is a beautiful, and horrible thing.

It can be used for so many things... and shouldn't be used for about 90% of 'em...
Yup..  when I started at a megacorp, we had to do a whole sequence of tests against a server to decree if it was down or not.   I built a collection of batch files (circa '98 with zero resources) that would take the server name, look it up in CSV file (so..many..FORs) and then run tests based on what it was...

I got a call like four years later, after the helpdesk had shut down and moved already, asking for assistance with it...since it was "running slow"...  
It's a joke about EVE Online.... at the surface, it's a game about flying around in ships, pewpewing at stuff until it explodes.

However, EVE is almost 100% a player economy.     It's kind of staggering in that regard.

That ship that you just blew up?   It was built by a player.

Those guns and engines that were one it?   Built by a player.

The ammo those guns were using?   Yup, Built by a player.

The materials used to build the ship, ammo, etc?  **mined** by a player.

The volatile chemicals used to build the [whatever]?   Extracted by a player..

There's "random drops" from killing NPCs, but they tend to be "vendor trash".

Almost **everything** in the game is player built... that creates a slew of meta games within Eve.    

There are players that all they do is accept contracts to take an item from location A, to location B and drop it off.    

There are players that "stare at rocks" (mining) and sell the raw materials they get.

There are players that just play the market itself.  The EVE universe is big. [So if you found something that was underpriced in one market, and overpriced in another](https://eve-central.com/home/quicklook.html?typeid=22448) (just a random product, not a good example), you could purchase them from System A, pay someone to ship them to System B, offer them for sale in System B slightly undercutting the current offers, and potentially reap a reward.

.

That's where the spreadsheets come in.   Unless you're **just** flying around, blowing stuff up, there's a heap of information to track to know what is the most profitable venture at the moment, what to build, where to build, etc.
Spreadsheets like excel and google, yes. Essentially Eve is a super complicated game in which many people develop sophisticated spreadsheet skills to aggregate and interpret market data among other things. [This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1doPl80zColYHC3lXiwmRBALd9dzl-30pyC7EZCiBogo/edit?pli=1#gid=0), [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1yzMAgbZuMZ2IisP--F6YAeNiIsMXoHYAGwcpv9vZEMo/htmlview?sle=true#), and [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak4fR6OJBaCedGZvLUxJUHZfcGJVSVh5dWdFcW5KTmc&usp=sharing#gid=3) are some of the simplest ones I am willing to make public but they get much, much more complex.
What a strange thing. 
This is exactly my thought process. 
It's so sketch!

Where's the job description, skills required, compensation, duration, field? We know nothing about the role other than excel expert.  Even if I was in Houston I wouldn't be interested in working for a hiring manager as sloppy as this. Post a link to the advert...

Also not only are your contributions on this sub available to the prospective employer but everything you've said on any topic is out there. I remember a few years back hearing that employers would demand your Facebook and other social media information, yet I've never seen this in practice and would never share it.  My personal life is personal, my employers are respectable people whose personal lives are personal.  I never thought I'd say this as I'm not into porn, but if you were would you want your future employer to know about your fetish?

The only way I could see this working is posting a link to the job advert and asking people to apply saying they saw it in Reddit.

Searching for a job is a two way street. This employer hasn't made the company look like an attractive place to work. 
It could also be a company that has a strained budget to start with, has a job that needs to be done, wants it done in a reasonable and cost effective way, and happens to have someone who knows enough to visit a place with a lot of fish to cast in a line.  If I needed to hire help, I would post a notice here and give the contact information.  I would also put together an excel quiz that would demonstrate facility with formulas, pivot tables, and vba.
You're only partially correct here, and I've been purposefully vague. The situation is this: we signed a contract with a software development company to build something out for us from the ground up to handle all of our data. We spent months and agreed to pay close to a million dollars upon completion(a  good portion was paid up front, though). They've dragged their feet throughout the entire process, have yet to fulfill a single achievement in "phase 2" or beyond and once confronted about the fact that we are now facing a deadline, they decided to pull everything out from under our feet, leaving us completely screwed with massive amounts of data and limited knowledge on how to process it. We are taking legal action, and seeking a new company. But for the time being, we need a magical wizard to come in here and save our asses until we find out long term solution. Like I mentioned above, the right person could find their forever career here. We've discussed that this hypothetical savior could save our asses for now, then be our liaison between ourselves and the new company we use. 
Thanks for your response. 

You're a kind, generous person.

I see that by helping people out you're acquiring skills that you may not in your job and field.  I guess most don't get these little puzzles at work because we each just do our own jobs. 

For me, this is what I do. I'm an excel specialist and I work contact projects to help people streamline their spreadsheets. When I see the work y'all do for free, I'm like, I get paid well for that stuff..

I hope they find the help they need, yet I don't support under paying analysts unless it's a non profit.  
I'm in Norway so I have no idea what these 1099 contracts etc mean. However, I work for a large company with large budgets and I'd have no qualms recruiting from this sub.

Hell, if anyone here has mad excel skills, lives in western Norway and also happens to have b2b sales experience feel free to mail me your resume right now. The skills I regularly see here far exceed what the recruiters send me.
You're welcome Chris! 
Never played eve, but I can vouch for how complicated some of these economies inside some MMOs can get.  FFXI was like this for a time, but it moved more towards random drops, as there were some pretty big wealth/powerful items disparities between the wealthy and non-wealthy.

I was certainly one of those people who liked playing the economics.  I just kept buying low and selling high, and built up a knowledge of the market over time, knowing when to buy one item and upgrade it to sell, or when to break items down etc.  I was always amazed anyone did actual work for their money in the game, as there were so many inefficiencies to be exploited (not in game design, but in the difference between buyers and sellers motivations/willingness to pay over times of the weekly/monthly/yearly cycles.)
Eve-Online is literally the reason I chose my degree and became good at Excel.  That game is the closet one can get to "real world" experience, a lot of the things I do now are nowhere near as complex.

Sadly once you start doing it full time for a living some of the fun dies.
Wow! This is pretty fascinating. TIL.

So this is all happening virtually?
And this is all based in a virtual economy?  With no exchange of currency used in the physical plane?
I'm really liking your idea of putting a quiz together... However, I am no excel wizard. I can vlookup and pivot table with the best of them, but that's about as "advanced" as I can go. Would you be interested in helping me put a quiz together?
In Americanese, it breaks down to this:

BTW, these are both IRS/Tax form names.

**W-2**: You are an employee of the company, they pay part of the taxes demanded by the government, provide you a place to work, equipment to use, dictate what you do, and when you do it.      Also tend to provide things like Health insurance, vacation/sick days and random other perks.

**1099**: You are effectively a one-person company that the client pays.   They tell you what they want done, and perhaps when they want it done by, and they hand you a wad of money at set intervals.     Issue there is you're responsible for the Employee taxes, the Employer taxes, your own insurance (now mandatory), your own equipment, etc, etc...

If you had a W-2 gig that paid X, for a 1099 to have nearly the same effective pay, the billing rate would need to be nearly 2X.    I did the math one day, it hurt my brain just how much expense was hidden as a W-2 employee.
Yup, completely virtual.    

In certain sections of space, the players are actually the government, right down to taxes, resource exploitation and defense.

Go check out /r/dreddit   They'll happily give you a... I think it's month long free trial now, and they love "newbros"... they'll teach you how to fly, how to explode gloriously and all sorts of fun shit.

Spreadsheets in Space come later. :)
There is actually a one way real money transfer mechanism in eve. 

Basically you can buy monthly subscription tokens (plex) for real money and sell them legally in game for in game money (isk) but the reverse is not allowed. 

So the game is free if you buy your subscription every month with in game money and an exchange rate between plex and real money can be used to extrapolate isk:usd.
Aah, we have this in Norway too. It's a way smaller, less serious firms tend to use to put all the risk on the employee.

I can see the value in getting a few specific projects done on contract, or have a consultant on contract for a short while. Which is what a 1099 sounds like to me.

In Norway, a lot of young inexperienced people do this and end up shafted by fucking up their taxes because they don't realise the difference between hiring yourself out as a consultant/contractor and being an actual employee.
So it's something you pay to do...ah. 

"Newbros", is it lady friendly?
You got it exactly right on the 1099 AND on the repercussions.     

W-2, the taxes are taken out before you get the check.  No fuss, no Muss.   

1099?  There are no taxes taken out, period.. so unless you have the discipline to squirrel away the "taxes" into a bank account, you're going to get fucked over when tax time rolls around, and suddenly you owe the government thousands of dollars which you spent on a super-awesome new motorcycle or something.

Nice to know kids are irresponsible everywhere.
