VBA multiple conditions
     Sub LearnAboutCase()
    
        Dim x As Integer 'First example will use numbers
        x = 3 'Let's try three!
    
        Select Case x
        Case Is > 3
            MsgBox "x is larger than three"
        Case Else
            MsgBox "x is three or less"
        End Select
        
     '''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

        Dim y As String 'Now, let's do strings
        y = "D" 'Let's try "D"!
        
        Select Case y
        Case "A", "B", "C"
            MsgBox "y is A, B or C"
        Case Else
            MsgBox "Y isn't A, B or C"
        End Select
    
     End Sub
Another option is if/elseif/else.  As in:

    If x = 3 Then
       <code>

    Elseif x=4 then 
      <code>

    Else
       <code>

    End If

I find if groupings like this to be a lot more flexible than Case blocs.  If you need to check all three to run a single bloc of code, then it would simply be 

    If (x = 3 OR x = 4 OR x = 5) Then
           <Code>
    Else 
           <Code>
    End If

A bit counter-intuitive but try this:

    If !(value=A and value=B and value=C) Then

I learn something new every day. This was the perfect solution for what I'm trying to do. Thanks!!

Yay success!

Feel free to jump in next time you get stuck. We're friendly here.
Select case is a good option if you understand the syntax but if you want to stick with If/Then, you would do:

    If  X <> A And X <> B And X <> C Then
        'your code
    End If

Where X is your variable.

How would you say if x = a, B, or c. Without doing nested if.
    If X = A Or X = B Or X = C Then

    End If
