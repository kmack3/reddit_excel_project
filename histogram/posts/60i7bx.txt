Better learning/reference method: books or bookmarking web pages?
The YouTube channel "ExcelIsfun" has a ton of great tutorials and docs to work with. It's so much more helpful than a book. 
Not sure about buying books myself. I typically head over to stack overflow. I find 90% of my questions are already answered. It maybe isn't the best way to learn VBA since it's more of a Q&A rather than tutorials, but it helps to see similar questions being asked to what you might be trying to accomplish. I've learned through trial and (lots) of error. 

I would imagine books would provide lots of sample problems and solutions, so they might give a better base to work from. Then again YouTube has plenty of tutorial series you could check out.

Flair changed to discussion
I bought a huge VBA Excel book from a known author, but found it to be relatively lacking and haven't used it much.    It might be OK to give you an intro into concepts, but from a "how to do X", a far better resource is Google searches:   "Excel VBA *********".
As other users have mentioned, StackOverflow is a super handy reference. There are others out there. 

The main thing a book can teach you is discipline start to finish. Having no prior coding experience when learning VBA means your code is probably going to be disorganized and hard to follow. I cringe looking back at earlier work. A book teaches you tutorials, sure, but if it's any good, those tutorials will show you the proper way to organize your code.

There is no substitute, from a book or Internet. Find a problem and GoogleFu it.
cant agree with this enough. The tutorials are absolutely fantastic.
Google is my go to. I just bookmark all the solutions I find. I was curious if these books are good for reference
