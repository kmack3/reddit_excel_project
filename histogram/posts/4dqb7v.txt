How to delete data based on values in another field.
Ok, think I got it.

For every PA number, if there isn't a corresponding H4 or H14 in the SP column, delete every row of that PA number.  If there *is* a corresponding H4 or H14, keep the PA number.

This should achieve that, but let me know if I've got the logic wrong.  With that logic, in your example above out of PA numbers 071564-071561, only 071561 should remain?

**Please save your workbook before running this macro in case things go awry.  Also note that you must have the sheet on which to run this as the activesheet and you'll probably need to change the variables `colSP` and `colPA` (lines 9 and 10) to their respective columns in your worksheet.**

    Sub Deleter()
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    Dim i As Long, j As Long, lastRow As Long
    Dim colSP As String, colPA As String
    Dim startRow As Long, endRow As Long
    Dim checker As Long
    
    colSP = "I"
    colPA = "B"
    lastRow = Cells(Rows.Count, colSP).End(xlUp).Row
    
    For i = lastRow To 2 Step -1
        If Cells(i, colPA) <> Cells(i + 1, colPA) Then
            endRow = i
        End If
        
        If Cells(i, colPA) <> Cells(i - 1, colPA) Then
            startRow = i
            checker = 0
            For j = endRow To startRow Step -1
                If Cells(j, colSP) = "H4" Or Cells(j, colSP) = "H14" Then
                    checker = 1
                End If
                If j = startRow And checker = 0 Then
                    Range(Cells(startRow, 1), Cells(endRow, 1)).EntireRow.Delete _
                    shift:=xlUp
                End If
            Next j
        End If
    Next i
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
    End Sub
