What are the best online classes?
I used [This](http://excelexposure.com/lesson-guide/) with great success. It covers some of the topics you are looking for. Note in the side bar there is a list of good excel sites, and there's a great [sticky](http://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/2e28s3/rexcel_advice_thread_repository/) on the main page with helpful excel stuff. 
Hi there, have seen Chandoo's classes. Excellent videos and great support. Not only is the content great, but also they are good guys.

In the PowerPivot class now.  There is some really great content there.  Rob Collie who does the majority of the teaching does an excellent job starting from the beginning and getting pretty spicy on the dax scale by the end of things.
I'm starting to get into the tutorials WiseOwl has to offer, both on Youtube and http://www.wiseowl.co.uk/
