How to turn off "sticky" copy
If it's a new bug, I haven't seen it yet, so this is pure guessing. Are you getting the message in Status Bar showing that clopboard is still active? Can you press Esc to clear it?
Oh thanks, escape clears it (that I didn't think of trying that lol).

When this bugs happens it doesn't show that clipboard is active in the status bar.
Weird. I'll keep an eye out for that update then, see if it screws something up. Or, for us both, there's the old adage of "turn it off, then back on again" lol.
The only side-effect I've noticed so far is that the search function (control F) is sometimes blocked by it (falsely stating that no match exists).

Edit: I've also tried it in different files and different formats, it happens in all of them. Thus certainly something Excel related and not bound to a certain file. I'm running Office 365 ProPlus, version 1705 (Build 8201.2025).

Edit2: Excel also sometimes loses focus automatically. For example in the name manager when double clicking a name, the window won't appear but I'll have to click on excel again for it to appear (also happens with some other options).
Is your search function looking in Values or Formulas?

Press the Options button to find it.
