Excel is changing all the values of the numbers I type in
Sounds like you have this set to a European language or locale. Over there periods mean 1000's. 

Make sure you set Excel to be US based and with US metrics. Otherwise, periods denote thousands elsewhere. 
What do you mean by 'registers'

Does it change the value? 

Is it part of a formula?

Check Options> Advanced > Automatically insert a decimal point

Thanks everyone , I got it. Options -> Advanced -> Check "Use system separators" 

it had "." set for thousands separator. 
Would this be under language because everything is set to US english. 
there are no forumals.

By register I mean this

I type 

"3.994" in the cell and then excel is basically multiplying it by 1000, so in the forumla bar, it is showing up as 3994. Then when I go to make my graphs, all the data points are multiplied by 1000. 

So, If I want a point with coordinates of (3.994, 3.714E-03) I am getting (3994, 3.174E-3)
This did not do anything. 
Hello!

It looks like you tried to award a ClippyPoint, but you need to reply to a particular user's comment to do so, rather than making a new top-level comment.

SOLUTION VERIFIED!
What happens if you use a comma instead of a period?

Relevant settings to change this are (this is Excel 2010, might be somewhere else in different versions)

File -> Options -> Advanced -> Use System Separators

You can uncheck it to manually set the decimal separator and Thousands separator if necessary.
See link. Specifically for dates but likely same for numbers.

It would be nice of you to verify Nateorade's comment, seeing as he's the one who pointed this out.
Well, he lead me to finding this but didn't actually give it. He said my region may be off. It wasn't. 

Then later I found this myself. 

LynchpinPuzzler is actually the one who gave the same solution that I found. 
It's rare to see someone downvoted in /r/excel but you still haven't gone back and given solution verified to /u/LynchpinPuzzler
I've never seen anyone verify their own issue either
That's because I figured it out on my own before he replied, or at least before I read it. Hence I haven't given it to him. If it's that big of a deal, fine. 
OP posted their solution a couple of minutes before my post.
Fair enough but he could still give you the point!
