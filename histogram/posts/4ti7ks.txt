I am tasked with picking out a powerful Excel desktop for around $500. What are some good specs?
Excel benefits a lot from a lot of cache, and a fast single-thread processor when you use VBA. Multiple cores and hyperthreading will help somewhat on the front end, but is great when you need to save and reconstruct the calculation chain. I have yet to see Excel use more than 6 GB of ram doing what I do (which is not what you do).
Ram & 64-bit version Excel are very important.
If you work with poverpivots get 64bit excel and 8gb of ram
/r/sysadmin might be able to help actually
* WIN7 - 64bit
* 512 SSD hard drive
* 8GB memory
* i5 processor

You'll be fine...

As far as I am aware Excel is capped at 2GB RAM usage. When did that change?
Doesn't excel 64 still have constraints? Like most addins don't work
I disagree.  It seems like he's been tasked to purchase this for his job, so you want something with a full warranty and customer support.  And at this price point and use case a prebuilt is usually cheaper.
Things that Excel should not be used for. :P
This changed when Excel went 64-bit. The 32-bit version of Excel is still limited to 2 GB (inclusive of 2016 and O365).

Somewhere here is where it states the memory limitations:

I have only had to modify declare statements.

Some proprietary 3rd party add-ins might not work, particularly those which haven't been updated in a few years. 

32-bit Excel is limited to 1 GB of ram.

Cheers!
I as in the programmer of the addin? I use bpc a lot (both osoft and epm) can't see them doing that any time soon
I use Excel for process related activities since no system exists to do it. I also use Excel for ETL due to a lack of any integration of systems.

I also use Excel to do what Excel should be used for, which is displaying and manipulating data, sometimes the data is even numeric.
"Since no systems exist to do it"

Haha I have been there before. Good luck to you!
>I use Excel for process related activities since no system exists to do it. I also use Excel for ETL due to a lack of any integration of systems.

Can you elaborate? Surely you're not talking about scheduling activities (i.e. stuff you could do in MSproject or Primavera) 
I wish it was task oriented, e.g., gantt chart like.

1. No system... Imagine 2 departments each with different needs that need to share data. Each department has their own sets of Excel files that need to share data. There is no central database (not even Access). This is a many-to-many relationship between Excel files.

2. There is a system. But the data entry point is still in Excel. That is, the system was not built to support the process that sits in Excel, but was built to import a very basic CSV.
Oh jeez, what sort of industry left you like that?
