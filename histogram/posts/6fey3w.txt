[help] need to mass delete "false" rows
This macro should do what you need. Replace A with whichever column has the TRUE/FALSE. Make sure to do this in a new copy of your workbook in case something goes wrong you don't lose data.

    Sub DeleteFalseRows()
    
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    
    For Each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets
    
        For x = ws.Range("A" & ws.Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row To 1 Step -1
        
            If ws.Range("A" & x).Value = False Then
            
                ws.Rows(x).Delete
            
            End If
        
        Next x
        
    Next ws
    
    End Sub
This can be done with VBA

Note, do a backup before you try this

    Sub Delete_Rows()

    Dim rng As Range, cell As Range, del As Range
    dim sht as Worksheet

    For x = 1 To 250
    set sht=Sheets(x)
    set del=Nothing 

    Set rng = Intersect(sht.Range("Z1:Z5000"), sht.UsedRange)
    For Each cell In rng.Cells
    If (cell.Value) = "FALSE"
    Then
        If del Is Nothing Then
            Set del = cell
        Else
            Set del = Union(del, cell)
        End If
    End If
    Next cell
    If not del is nothing then del.EntireRow.Delete
    Next x

    End Sub

This assumes the TRUE/FALSE is in column Z and it goes 5000 rows. Adjust as you see fit.
This appears to be working,  its been running for about an hour and i am getting a little antsy.  Do you know if it is reading each value line by line? 
An hour sounds way too long, but if it's legitimately 250 sheets with a lot of rows per sheet, I guess that's possible. If you want to stop code while it's running, hitting the Escape key multiple times usually does the trick.
