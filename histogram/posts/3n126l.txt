Happy 30th Birthday Excel!
I'd like to see some of us try and use the first edition of excel. Kinda like when they had graphic designers [attempt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtA46JT2q_0) to use the first version of photoshop. 
And I'm sure there are still some of those spreadsheets doing business critical functions out there somewhere in an institutional basement! 


I thought about doing a little write-up but life got in the way, basically looking at how people used to get help for excel though bulletin boards and what not.

A lot of the old data can still be easily accessed,

For example here, 260000 posts going back to 1996 (and some recent ones too:. I'm on mobile right now so I can't check, but it's fun if you narrow down the search to the earliest posts. A lot of the questions were very similar to the questions we see every day today ::) vlookup saving the world for at least 20 years :p

If anyone who's used excel for a long time have some anecdotes that'd be fun too!






This video is amazing, happy birthday Excel
Excel, at every phase of my professional life, has been the greatest source of my success. It's been more useful than my undergrad learning entirely, and in grad school it was all we ever used, minus some dataviz applications.
 
It's nuts just thinking about it. Literally every job I have had, from undergrad to today, spanning almost a decade, the moment I became made at that job is when I did *something* with Excel that made people say whoa.
TIL I am older than Excel.
And there I was, using Lotus 1-2-3.
Uh, no. I use 90% kb shortcuts. I would die.
usually LOOKUP is sufficient enough and you don't need to use VLOOKUP
I hear ya. [This was great](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/thisdayintech/2011/01/Lotus123_spreadsheet.jpg) but when Lotus with Wysiwyg came along... oh man, the great leap forward.
kb shortcuts?
Index match-match... When I learned of it my co worker was like, "its vlookup that can go left and right"... My world changed.
Daniels was making 250k a year back then.  Started with Fiklore, got bored of her and hired Hugh.  Gave Fiklore a 5k raise to shut her up.  /s
keyboard shortcuts
lol!
