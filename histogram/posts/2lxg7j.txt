Quick help with formula. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
Try something like:

    ="216.105."&A4&".0"
You could have also done =CONCATENATE("216.105.",A4,".0")

If A4 = hello then the output would be:  216.105.hello.0

I prefer to use concatenate over & just to be consistent.. and it's a weird preference.

Also, I'm not sure how I clicked on your post from 2 months ago - I was redditing late last night and when I opened up my laptop today your post was open.
Thank you, It's been an extremely long day and I knew it was something simple that I was forgetting.
