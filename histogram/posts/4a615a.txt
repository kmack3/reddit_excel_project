Having trouble with website login macro
Wow, I had no idea excel could do any of this. I am slowly teaching myself vba, but this is impressive. 
At what part is the macro not working? Have you tried stepping through it line by line to see what works and what doesn't?
Yep, it breaks down at the username input step.  I get the "Object doesn't support this property or method" error 438
Replace

    .getElementByID("USERNAME-citiTextBlur").Value = "Username"
    .getElementByID("password").Value = "Password"

with

    .document.getElementByID("USERNAME-citiTextBlur").Value = "Username"
    .document.getElementByID("PASSWORD").Value = "Password"

Note the password element in all caps is necessary.
Awesome, thanks man.  It works like a charm. If you have another second, the sign on button code is a little funky too.  I tried switching between getElementByID and getElementByName, neither seem to work...
Solution Verified
Replace 

    Set button = .document.getElementsByName("Sign In") 'id of the button control (HTML Control)
    button.Submit

with

    Set a = .document.getElementsbytagname("input")
    For Each e In a
       If e.alt = "Sign On" Then Exit For
    Next
    e.Click
