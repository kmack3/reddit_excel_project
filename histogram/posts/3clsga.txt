Official Excel suggestions website
It's pretty barren and out of 66 ideas 61 are for Excel online.
Just posting in case people are interested as I haven't seen it mentioned elsewhere. Sorry if this is not appropriate for this subreddit - I'm still learning.
Are you in Orlando, by chance?  I know that Microsoft is in town at the OCCC
I don't believe that has anything to do with Microsoft for two simple reasons

1. Not on a Microsoft domain
2. The legal disclaimer is under a million characters
Let's fix that!
No, I'm in London
Yeah that's a reasonable impression. I think it's legit because I was in the audience when it was mentioned by someone from Microsoft who was asking us to use it. From a quick search I found the page http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/03/26/visual-studio-upcoming-features-timeline.aspx

If you search for "UserVoice" on that page, you will find a link within the blog to http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/.

Edit: Formatting
I just included a bunch in Excel for Windows (Desktop Application)
Out of interest what was the event?  Is it part of a series / open to anyone?
Though it doesn't make any explicit mention that it is official on MS's page
It was ICAEW's "Twenty principles for good spreadsheet practice â€“ one year on" event. It's a part of a series in a way. The details are at: http://www.icaew.com/events/2015/july/titfsem150708-twenty-principles-for-good-spreadsheet-practice
Yeah, I don't know why it's like that
