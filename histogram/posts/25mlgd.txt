Best Online Course to Learn Macros
ExcelVBAIsFun YouTube channel

It's really good!
Excel 2013 Power Programming with VBA by John Walkenbach is a great resource for the bookshelf. 
I learned purely via macro recorder. I knew some VB going in though, and had experience with C++/Python/MATLAB
Save
Lynda.com Macros in depth is a pretty good overall intro. Just to not get scared by VBA and getting used little by little to the code.
Are you familiar with the VBA language? If not, that's what you'll need to learn...

Chandoo.org is a helpful community for various excel topics/levels
VBA for Dummies by Walkenbach. The rest is just a matter of practice.

I know it isn't online, but it's a very good source.
Thanks guys I'll check all these places out
Any of you know if learning VBA or Macros is better? Or a better question, what is the difference if any?
How does this fare against VBA for Dummies?

I'm pretty competent with standard Excel and have some basic VBA experience but not sure where to start.
Not that familiar, is that in the same category as putting in a msgbox?

I took a crash course from my boss before he left - learned how to write "code" for Do While, For Next, and deal with 2 dimensional Arrays. Basic stuff I believe. 
Yes... I'm reading it now... I already know some vba but just the first 4 chapters have taught me a few things that I'm like "oh, that makes way more sense"
VBA is the language behind macros.
I love the Power Programming book. I have not used the Dummies book. I like the author though.
I haven't looked at VBA for Dummies.  
You already know more than I do in regards to vba lol
Excel macros are written in VBA.
