Most useful differences between 2013 and 2010?
Opening multiple files on separate screens in the same instance. 
PowerPivot is built in. Finally, I could distribute my work to everyone without them having to install the add-in!
Slicers, seriously this is probably the biggest thing for me.
FlashFill saves me so much time.
Depends a lot on one's opinion of SDI vs MDI. Excel 2013's SDI supports multiple monitors better. OTOH, putting 2 or more document windows in the same monitor is a royal PITA in Excel 2013 (and 2016) compared to Excel 2010 (and prior).

I can't move to 2013. How can you stand the UI? It's... wretched. I *like*... the non-flatness of 2010. 
isformula is built in to detect when someone keyed over formulas, webservice, [full list of new functions here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/New-functions-in-Excel-2013-075c82bd-15b9-4ad6-af31-55bb6b011cb9).



Makes every version prior to 2013 unusable to me
Oh god, that is so simple a fix, but so helpful.
You can do that in Excel 2010 but you have to open another window using the excel shortcut on your desktop first. 
I've barely worked with PowerPivot for that very reason. Any reporting I put together I would have to either have people come to me, or send them a static view of what I put together. That and getting a piece of software installed at my last job was slower than an act of congress.
Slicers are in 2010.
Cool.  Never heard of it until now.  The [MS page](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-AutoFill-and-Flash-Fill-2e79a709-c814-4b27-8bc2-c4dc84d49464?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US&fromAR=1) on it shows a simple example with formatting names.  Can you describe another example of when it might be (or has been) useful?  

Regardless, it looks helpful.  I'll start playing around with it myself, thanks.
windows key + left / right arrows snaps the active window to 50% screen left/right  
You cab change the theme to "dark grey" which makes it look simliar to Excel 2010. It annoyed me as well but that was all I had to change.
Interesting, I much prefer the flatness
Office 2003(?) had that functionality.
And because it is a separate application instance copy-paste, macros and add-on don't work between them. So it's a work-around, but not a good one.
The timeline slicer specifically was introduced in 2013 and is a great feature. Filtering by date/time was always a pain before this.
Pretty much any time you would use left, mid or right. We get a lot of reports at work with product numbers and descriptions in the same cell so I use it to pull out the number and other bits such as weight, also useful with addresses.

It can also be used to merge segments of cells together, such as street name in one column and city in another.

Other tip if it doesn't quite get them all correct. Correct the a few that are wrong and it'll update its logic on other wrong ones.
That's Windows functionality rather than Office/Excel, and FWIW doesn't work under Windows Vista which can run Excel 2010, 2013 and 2016.
I tried that, it wasn't enough. Did the allow any more options in 2016? 

P.S. I love that I'm downvoted for expressing my opinion (not saying it's you).
No it didn't. You could open multiple workbooks but only inside the one main application window, so it was no good for multi-monitor setups.

2013 is the first version to get that right.
Exactly!
Ah ha! Good to know. 
Welcome to reddit! :D I gave you a balance upvote so you're back to 1!
Yeah, apparently there is a black version I am keen on trying
:)
I'll look into this. Thank you.
I used Windows Accessibility options to set the High Contrast theme, then modified it to suit myself. Makes pretty much everything black.

Unfortunately, doing this means you're unable to see certain things, like coloured cells, but it was the only way I could find to get 2013 into a state where I could use it most of the day without a headache.
