Changed my font in VBA editor. Seems to be working out well.
I use this in my IDEs (VBIDE included):

[Source Code Pro](http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?event=displayFontPackage&code=1960)

It's open source to boot.
[Notepad ++](http://s30.postimg.org/y4qssky8x/screenshot_3.png)

Allows you to edit just about everything... has pre installed themes, and a whole slew of languages to work with... 
I dig it. How customizable is it? Is there a "night mode" where you can have a dark background and lighter text?
This is also my coding font.
Awesome! Downloaded. thanks
I had no idea that Notepad ++ has Visual Basic as a language it recognizes. I usually don't like Notepad++, but I might have to check it out if my favorite (Sublime Text Edit) doesn't have VB. 

Thanks for this info!
Man, if I could step through code with Notepad++...

Code folding, full color pallet, ...yeah
[Easily enough](http://imgur.com/XTIwysL). Downside is: you only have like 16 colors to work with.
Not too shabby! And this is the actual VBA editor through Excel?
Yep!
