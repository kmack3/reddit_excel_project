Can someone walk me through how to stop this popup everytime I open an excel file please.
Data Tab > Edit Links > Do not Show Start Up Prompts

However, it has to be done on a file-by-file basis.
Thank you.

If it is a shared file will it work for all users?

There's a way of disabling across the board, but I'll have get home and look at the settings to remember.  IIRC, there are two options within trust center settings that need to be changed.
