12 Excel Keyboard Shortcuts for Every User
For those of you who would like a list of all Excel keyboard shortcuts, there's one here: http://t7.net.au/all-keyboard-shortcuts/
As a heathen mac user, one shortcut I really wish I could custom set is Paste Values. I probably use it about 30 times a day in my work.
I was familiar with a lot of these, but I've never used F9 before! Thanks for the great tip.
I'd add ctrl+tab and ctrl+pg up or pg dn.

Good use of f4 is helpful sometimes also.

No love for control-shift-8? Always saves me time when I'm making a pivot
A few shortcuts I like:

* Shift + F9 = Calculate formulas on current sheet (I turn off formulas for giant worksheets so it doesn't take my 100 year old work computer hours to calc).
* Ctrl + 0 = Hide selected columns // Add in Shift (Ctrl + Shift + 0) to unhide
* Ctrl + 9 = Hide Selected Rows // Add in Shift (Ctrl + Shift + 9) to unhide
* Ctrl + - = Delete selected rows or columns!
* Ctrl + R -> Fill right
* Ctrl + D -> Fill Down


Alt E, S, V enter!!![Paste Values] You will never use another shortcut more. 
i find i use shift+spacebar (highlight entire row) the most

not sure why

arent these version sensitive? I dont remember excel 2007's shortcuts working on 2010... (not all anyway)
ALT-= â€“ Instant AutoSUM Function??????

Sir.. Thank you.. just (wiping away tears of joy) Thank you..

Wall street oasis has a pretty good one as well. 
Create absolute reference is two keys on Mac. I'm convinced Excel for Mac is a joke. I forced myself to use my Mac through a few Excel based classes last year and it was painful coming from an all Windows environment. 
Idk about Mac but I added paste value to my quick shortcuts so all press is alt+1
alt,  e,  s, v? or does that not work on mac?
Does better touch tools not have a solution for you?
Can you not add it to the ribbon? I can on Windows, but I'm not familiar with Office for Mac.
Not sure about Mac but I think the most underused button is the one between Ctrl and alt on the right side. It brings up the right click menu and you can then paste values by just clicking v I believe. I use the button for all kinds of shit. 
alt-h-v-v
Use the formula =RANDBETWEEN(bottom,top) in one cell.

Extend the formula to fill a region all full of random numbers.

Select all this region of numbers.

Insert a chart (any chart) with these numbers as source data.

Put some music in the background.

Press and hold F9
I never knew about ctrl+tab, this will make my life so much easier. Thank you for that shortcut.
I'm fairly certain that initiating a pivot table automatically selects the current region. 
All of them at the same time?
You're welcome! Your comment made our day. Thank YOU! =)
This should blow Windows-only minds.... Excel for Mac doesn't even have an "Evaluate Formula" function.....  was so key for me to learn nested IFs or writing a index match match
There's a shortcut that opens a dialogue but it doesn't help much when you still need to lift one hand to move the cursor to select "Value"
You're a madman! I like it. 
True. Probably use it more for just copy/paste. 
well, now I am 100% never getting a mac.
oh, thats sad, on windows the last v selects value for you.
