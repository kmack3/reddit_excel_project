Can I delete duplicate rows with an IF function?
Place this at H1 (or really anywhere on the first row) and drag down: 

    =IF(COUNTIF(D:D,D1)+COUNTIF(F:F,F1)>2,0,1)

then sort & filter by lowest numbers. Delete all the rows with 0's, which should all be at the top. 
I have encountered a problem with this.  Column D is First names, and F is addresses.  "JOHN" is a super common first name, but 1836 Wagner St only comes up once.  This formula would say that JOHN appears 32 times in column D while 1836 Wagner St only shows up once.  Equalling 33.  Which would produce a value of 0 and lead me to delete it even though it's not a duplicate row.  Do you see my issue?
nevermind!  haha I got it.  =IF(COUNTIF(D:J,D1:J1)>2,0,1) 
works and it settles that issue I just had
thank you kind gentleman!
