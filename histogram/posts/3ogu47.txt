What's in your Customize Toolbar ?
A few things, mostly macros

* Refresh all pivots
* Toggle what happens when clicking on a pivot table after typing "=" between bringing back the cell refference and bringing back the getpivotdata function
* Toggle direction when pressing enter (between right and down),
*Toggle if the active cell moves at all when enter is pressed
* Add IfError to all formula's in a selected range (or take them out), 
* Select all data not counting the first row, 

and a few more which I can't think of off the top of my head.
Refresh All, Paste Special, Conditional Formatting, Field Options, Com Add Ins, Pivot Wizard
Camera tool
Remove all filters
Select Current Region, Select Visible, Format Painter, Form.
Number formatting to the most common number format in my country that excel doesn't have as a preset. 
Paste values, insert row, clear filter, freeze panes, pivot table, switch windows, sort! 

Love the customised toolbar function! 
Nothing. I prefer hot keys. So, I have a battery of hotkeys that fire macros in my personal add-in. I use most of these every day:

* Make a data table and set up a pivot table in one step
* Format selection as text
* Format selection as accounting with 0-2 decimals (rotate through decimal setting on rapid repeats)
* Change pivot table category to use Sum and apply accounting format with 0 decimals
* Format automagically selected range with bold headers, remove word-wrap, and auto-width the columns
* Format columns with the string 'date' in the header to be mm/dd/yyyy
* Remove page-break overlays
* Paste Values / Formulas / Formats  *(although I typically use R-click V|F|R)*
* Filter | Clear Filter
* Sort | Sort A-Z | Sort Z-A
* Handful of macros

I should really add Text-To-Columns and Remove Duplicates since I get a ton of use out of those. Other than that I sit the menu on the Home tab and work with hotkeys.

Most-used macro simply sets the entire workbook to 10-pt Calibri, Zoom 100%, auto-size all columns, select A1. I deal with a *lot* of CSVs, poorly formatted sheets, and sheets saved in Excel for Mac. (Our entire office runs Macs; I run Excel in a Windows VM because it doesn't suck.) The latter type typically has zoom set to 150-200% due to the Windows/Mac native DPI disparity. And the added fact that many of our employees are 50+. Overall the macro saves me a ridiculous amount of time manually making things readable.
You're all missing Document Location 
Auto height.  Auto width. Set pivot table to tabular. Remove subtotals from pivot table. 
Removed Save then standard undo + redo.

Apply Filter

Clear Filter

Record Macro

A link to an exe I use a lot

A link to a folder I use a lot

Open Recent Files

A link to an SQL query to run on the current sheet

Format selected region into a pretty table

Turn on / off macros with notification.
Mostly macros but also the formula auditing drop-down and some home-brewed menus under the Menu Commands container. One of the macros deletes all styles, something I find myself needing to do way too often.
Could you link your iferror macro?
> Select all data not counting the first row,

but how ?  it would be very great if you explain all. 
How do you toggle the enter direction/how do you toggle whether it moves the active cell at all?
Can you do just select visible? I thought you could only tag the special tools in general and then select visible only. I need dis.
Hey fun fact for you!  You can filter / unfilter with CTRL + SHIFT + L.

This is probably my most used keyboard shortcut besides copy/paste.  
This one's one of my favorites. It's actually gone through about 3 revisons as I kept changing what it does so it's a bit hodpodegy but works for me now. http://pastebin.com/hUtyE57k
It's a macro I made. I use it at work and I don't have it on my home computer, but I'll e-mail it to myself tomorrow and update then.
I use a pair of macros, One toggles the direction and one toggles if it turns on or not. The macros can be found here http://pastebin.com/w0GmWsYT

If you need instructions on adding the macros to your own excel, follow the instructions here: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Copy-your-macros-to-a-Personal-Macro-Workbook-aa439b90-f836-4381-97f0-6e4c3f5ee566 then paste them into a module in the personal workbook.

There's even a shortcut to do it: select the filtered table and press CTRL+: 
all macros if you can. I amazed by now. really enchanted me.
Here's my entire macro set http://pastebin.com/6ExPhKEE

The select entire data set one is the top one. It was one I wrote when I was first starting to learn VBA so there's probably a better way to do it, but it does the trick for me. 

Other macros which I forgot include:

* Dragging formulas down. I tend to have a data sheet, then I manipulate the data with forumlas on another sheet. This macro asks for the sheet's names then does the dragging for me to make dragging the formulas down each week easier.
* Clear Filters takes off all the filters but leaves auto filter on. 

When it comes to VBA I'm entirely self taught so I'm sure other people would be able to write these in a tidier manner that follows best practice better.
You're the man.
