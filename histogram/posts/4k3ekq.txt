conditional formating. highlight columns based on 8 weeks from today.
Conditional formatting >New rule...  > Use a formula to determine which cells to format.  Enter:

    =C$8>NOW()+56
and set the yellow highlight format.
The dollar means it just looks at row 8, and checks if it is greater than NOW() (which returns the current date and time) plus 56 days (8 weeks x 7 days) (dates and times are all stored as decimals of a day, so 7.5 means 7 days 12 hours... NOW()+7 means one week from now, NOW()-0.25 means six hours ago, etc)

then go to Conditional formatting > Manage rules... in the 'applies to' box, type 

    =C:Y

This 'spreads' the conditional formatting over all columns from C to Y.  It still only looks at row 8 (because of that dollar) but the "C" Will virtually change to whatever column the cell is in.
