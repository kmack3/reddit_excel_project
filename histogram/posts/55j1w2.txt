Why does .xlsm file keep opening in Read Only?
Are you saving it locally or on a network drive?  This happens to me from time to time on my company network.  My IT guy can fix it but when he's not around, I just save as a different file name, delete the original and rename the new one.
You can save a file as read-only. If you go to the file -> right click -> properties -> last row in the properties window should list a box with read only and hidden.

This is my guess, could be something completely different.
Maybe try Excel Options>Trust Center? There are a few options for macros there
Are you referring to your personal macros? The ones saved inside a macro named personal?

Locate the PERSONAL.xlsm file which has your homemade macros you added to excel, right-click it, settings, check the box for read only. The file is inside your XLSTART folder. To locate, in a folder type %appdata% in the folder path field at the top, hit enter, navigate to the Excel folder, then XLSTART. 

I'm saving it locally, everything is on my laptop 
Ah! This won't work. 

I have macros that I want to run on open and close. I should technically be able to run the close ones but not the open one right? 
Another possibility could be your Excel file is used in some data connection. If it's used in mail merge and Word is open then Excel is read only, for example.
This is my guess.  It's how I make my important spreadsheets read only.
- Multiple times open (in different excel instances)
- Opening multiple different spreadsheets that reference the same macros.
Ctrl+O, then hold down shift when you're pressing Open
