Emoji's suddenly black can't find how to get back to full color. Help?
why are there emojis in your spreadsheet
If you open a new document, are they still black?
Once you go black...
How did you get the emojis on your spreadsheet? Is it a font?
Screenshot?
These emojis are just a font, like Wingdings? Wouldn't it be possible to just select them and then change the text color?
I found the following article about how to use emoji on your Mac. I know that's not what you asked for, but maybe something here will lead to color settings or something similar. What it almost sounds like is that they changed from emoji to emoticon somehow. Not sure, but I hope this helps. While this is the excel subreddit, it's clear most (if not all haha) of us are windows users. So it might be prudent to xpost this to a relevant mac subreddit if you haven't already. http://www.cultofmac.com/136018/use-emoji-on-your-mac-os-x-tips/ 
What is SS?

Is this an Excel problem?
This is the only question that matters
This problem reads like a deleted scene from The Office. I'm imagining Kevin presenting his Emojii spreadsheet to corporate.
Its Excel for Mac, and it is a built in feature.
Odd question. Because I'm using them for particular lists.  
I'm using a macbook.

Press the Command and Control keys on your keyboard. Then press the space bar. This will launch the characters palette.

Double-click on whichever emoji you'd like to use and it'll be inserted where you left your cursor.
Will Do.  Thank you =)
SS = Spreadsheet.
Do you mean bullets?
