Formula to Return Formula
Not quite. If you're just doing basic stuff, you might be able to use SUBTOTAL. The first argument in that function controls what operation is performed, so you could do a lookup to say whether you want to do a Count, Average, Sum, etc.

Otherwise, you'd need to build a big CHOOSE function to determine which formula, along lines of

    =CHOOSE(ControlCell, Formula1, Formula2, Formula3, etc.)
What if you created your own custom function with VBA and then use the first argument to determine which vba code to run in your custom function?

Have a look at INDIRECT(), it might fit your needs. 
This is pretty close to what I'm looking for. However, given the size of the list of various functions I'll be applying, I think the overall length of the formula could get a little unwieldy (in terms of QA, auditing, passing it off, etc).

Perhaps a custom function is in order? SUBTOTAL nearly fits my needs as well, if only I knew how to customize each of its sub-component function options.
This is the solution I'm exploring right now. It has a lot of promise so far, though there's a bit of a learning curve.

Solution Verified, and thanks for the support link.
