Are there any "professional" courses/resources for Excel?
there is actually currently a GROUPON out to save 98% on the excel course microsoft puts out. It goes from 249 CAD down to 9 CAD.
This course, offered by your local training facility, with accreditation from Microsoft..

Practice makes perfect.. practice practice practice so you remember what is available to you... and there is a lot available to you in Excel.. In my early day I would regularly read ALL the help file functions to know what was available and to practive using them..

All the training in the world will not help if you do not use it regularly and learn to understand its power - rather than just copy by rote.


This is an excellent question for a post, IMHO.  Basically, OP's right in that there are (arguably), a lot of basic-level resources out there, but perhaps not as many "professional" level, say dealing with the examples listed, such as data cleansing, ETL, error checking, and so on.  ...That is, these are typically some of the key functions that you'd do on a day-to-day basis.

Does anyone know of those kind of courses from, for instance, Khan Academy, Udemy, Coursera, Lynda.com, or what-not?  ...oddly, I don't think I've seen anything on that level.

Edit:  Thought of an analogy.  For financial/banking jobs, it wouldn't be enough to do, say, the Microsoft MOS-type tests.  Instead, you'd look at courses like [Breaking Into Wall Street](https://www.breakingintowallstreet.com) or [Training-the-Street](http://trainingthestreet.com) that go above the basics and focus on applied best practices for financial modeling, etc.  ...So, is there or are there any similar courses on other typical functions like FP&A?
