How to copy the numbers made by the formula and not the formula itself?
Copy the data and to paste it, right click and select paste special, and then select values.
Does the place where you're pasting need to update if the numbers in the column to the left change? If so, you may want to link with a formula rather than pasting values.
You can set paste special values to happen with alt+1 (or whatever number you want) by putting it in the quick access toolbar.
Thanks!
there's your answer
Keyboard shortcuts: Control-C to copy, alt-E-S-V then hit enter to paste special/values. 
Also CTRL+ALT+V, V, ENTER

Paste special can be a real time saver.
Also Alt+H+V+V
If you have the right mouse click button on your keyboard, just hit that + v to paste values. 
 I always just do CTRL+V, CTRL, V.
Ooooh I'm going to try that one tomorrow.
