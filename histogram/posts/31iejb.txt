Very useful collection of Excel Keyboard Shortcuts to boost productivity
I still use the legacy alt+ combinations from 2003 and before. Alt+d,f,f creates filters for example. 

I also couldn't live without the context menu key (usually next to the right ctrl key) for paste. It is the same as a right clicking on a cell or range, so you can quickly press context, s,v and paste values, s,s,e,v to transpose values, etc. 
My favourite new shortcut is Ctrl+F3 to bring up Name Manager.
another trick i learned recently was using the quick tools access bar (just over the ribbon). 
Assigning things up there can save a tremendous amount of key presses, since you only need to press Alt + a number instead of the usual Alt + H + P for percentage formatting, for example :)
Ctrl+Shift+1 all the way

Fastest SAVE-AS in the west... ALT then F then A.

Ctrl shift L
If you don't have the context menu key, use Shift + F10, it also brings up context menu. This has been a life saver for me on laptops. 
That's Cool!! My favourite is Ctrl +Shift+L to add or remove filters
Or Ctrl+F5 for cell teleportation
I loved that shortcut until I found this Name Manager add-in

You know about control + shift + 1-5 for fast formatting, right?
Good ol' Alt H V S V Enter...
You mean Ctrl + Alt + V? :)
I just always do Ctrl+V, Ctrl to open the paste menu, then press V. Doing that in succession quickly pastes as values.
Nope. Fastest Save As is F12. 
How do you get into the filter menu thing without clicking on the little box in the corner. I would love to know that
Why use filters alone when you can hit ctrl+t to make a table. Still get the filters, and a whole bunch of other benefits. 
I rather use that than trying to clear a filter. Just use that twice and your good to go.
I do now ;)
But I think its still a relevant way to access other things that are less accessible, such as symbols, for example.

Whoa! Awesome! Thank you!
With the cell selected, hold alt, press the down arrow. 
Menu key. To the right of the keyboard on pc's.
I use filter alone using Ctrl Shift L to do data anlaysis when I already have a table with big chunk of data in it.
Thanks for informing about Ctrl + T, I never knew that...
It brings up Paste Special which is better that what I posted above!
Yup, it's the same for most Microsoft software.  For some other programs such as adobe reader it's Ctrl+Shift+S.
Awesome. Thanks!
