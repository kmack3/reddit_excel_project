Is there a way to format millions and billions so that they show 12.051 Million or 1.2 Billion etc?
highlight the cell

click CTRL + 1 go to format -> custom

use this code: $#0.0,,,"BN"  

if you want more decimals after the "." just add more zeros before the ,,,"BN"

For millions only use two commas and "MM" instead of "BN"
Yes. You can do it with conditional formatting. 

Set your conditional format to say if the number is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 the number format will be 0.000,," Million" 
If it is greater than 1 billion, use three commas as the word Billion
And so on. 

ETA - the number format can be edited in the Number tab under Custom
Maybe some sort of if statement and concatenation. So if greater than one billion one way, and then the false will be the other way. 
This will do it for you

Just need to adjust for millions rather than thousands. 

For lazy, custom number format 

"#,###,##0," (I think)
Go to custom formatting and add comma at the end, that will remove 000, add another one for another three zeros etc
I assume that you could have 100.32 million as an option, therefore could you do something like =if(A1>1000000000000,A1/1000000000000&" Trillion",if(A1>1000000000,A1>1000000000&" Billion",if(A1>1000000,A1/1000000&" Million",A1)))?

I guess this assumes you're talking about money. If its not money you don't need the "$"
Solution verified
fyi, you can do something kind of like conditional formatting within the number format itself without actually invoking Excel's conditional formatting. Put the condition in [square brackets] followed by the format. See [this](http://simoncpage.co.uk/blog/2008/09/excel-custom-and-conditional-number-formatting/) for a better explanation.
I didn't get the solution from you but you came closest to what I ended finding for myself so the clippy is yours!
I don't know if it's possible, and I'm on mobile, but could you not use scientific notation to clean that up a little?
You're like an elementary school teacher I had. Could you explain?

Some of those are interesting.  Thanks. 
FYI you can award more than one Clippy point per thread, so if multiple people help you you can give them a point each.
I'm glad that you found something that works.  I am glad I saw your question because, even though I knew both parts of Excel, I never thought of tying those together like that. So I learned something. :-)
It's in the number formatting section. 
Why even post if you deliberately intend to not offer any useful advice? Somebody had a bad day..
Seemed useful at the time.
