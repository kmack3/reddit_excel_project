Excel shortcuts you probably didn’t know

A new one I learned the other day is highlighting a function or cell reference in a formula in the formula bar then hitting f9 will resolve/show the result for whatever you highlighted.
I've mentioned this before so sorry if it's redundant, but I have all Excel shortcuts listed (and ranked by my opinion of usefulness) in the [Master Workbook](http://excelexposure.com/workbook/) on my site.
1. Insert Sum:  Alt =
Summing has to be Excel's most commonly used task, and this trick can save you several clicks every time. To sum a column of numbers, select the cell at the bottom of the column. Then, Alt = will insert the sum function.
2. Select an Entire Column:   Ctrl-Spacebar 
You probably know that Alt-a will select everything on a page, but if you simply want to select one column, hit Ctrl-Spacebar. And if you want to select a single row, use Shift-Spacebar.
3. Navigate to Top:   Ctrl-Home
Big spreadsheets can be many pages long. Instead of scrolling, Ctrl-Home takes you back to the first cell: A1. And Ctrl-End takes you to the last cell.
4. Hide Data:   Ctrl-0
Sometimes, you just want to hide some data without deleting it. Here's the shortcut for that: select the column you want to hide, then hit Ctrl-0. To unhide it, use Ctrl-Shift-0. (Note: the "0" is the number zero, not the letter O.)
5. Delete a Cell:  Alt-E-D
When you want to fully delete a cell, you can certainly right-click and then hit delete, but I find it faster to keep my hands on the keyboard rather than going for the mouse. Alt-E-D. In my mind, it stands for Express Delete.
6. Add Date:    Ctrl-Semicolon
Ctrl-Semicolon inserts today's date. Ctrl-Shift-Semicolon inserts the current time.
7. Show Formulas:  Ctrl ~
Functions are the math formulas that give Excel its power. They are math equations that Excel computes and displays. Normally, you enter a function either in the formula bar or directly in the cell, and — when you hit enter — it displays the result. Once that's done, the underlying formula becomes hidden from view. But sometimes you need to check those hidden formulas. Sure, you can go back and click every cell to see them, but if you hit Ctrl and the tilde key, all your formulas will be revealed in their cells. Oh, and in case you didn't know, the tilde key is usually in the upper left corner of your keyboard and looks like this: ~
We'd love to learn your favorite Excel tip in the comments below or on our Facebook page.
Not posting this in the Yahoo comments because I don't want to create an account, but for the benefit of people here:

I think the shortcut for **7. Show Formulas:  Ctrl ~** is wrong. It should be **Ctrl `** (back-quote).

On UK, and presumably other keyboard layouts, the tilde isn't on the back-quote key.

Ctrl ~ (or Ctrl+Shit+BackQuote for you, Ctrl+Shift+Hash for me) sets the Number format to General.

But I appreciate the more people will recognise the tilde, and back-quote will be confused with apostrophe, so this probably doesn't matter for the target audience.
What about ctr-alt-arrow key to select to the end of the data set

No offense. But title is misleading, I knew them all. 

* Ctrl-1 brings up cell formatting options
* Ctrl-Shift-1/2/3/4/5 formats as number/Time/Date/Currency/Precentage
* Alt-O-C-A autofit's width on a column
* Ctrl + Arrow Keys jumps to next section with content or end of current section with content.
* Alt-E-S-V/F/T Paste Special Values/Formulas/Formats


Thats enough for now back to work, i'll try to list more later.
I knew all of them on the video (not all of them are useful) but yours are cool, and I have been dabbeling with excel and muscle memory for two decades. :))) thanks. 

Now, a question I had for some time - how do I add a thing like your shift-f9 to my postings? :)
shoot, alt-o-c-a and alt-e-s does not work for me as i am on a german excel.

what where those before in menu structure so i can translate them? thx
If you look towards the top-right-hand side of the page, below the Unsubscribe button, you should see your name, with Edit next to it.
thanks ;)
