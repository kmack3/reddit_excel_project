[Reward offered: $50] Generate a list of file names, dates and word counts

This post is okay to stay as we do not directly prohibit this.
I tried. It's not perfect yet but this is my output with 2 folders:

My Google-fu is pretty strong so I can hardly take any credit but it did take me a while to pierce everything together.  
  
I took the following steps:  
* Reference Word application in VBA (Alt-F11, Tools, REferences, search for Microsoft Word x.0, check)  
* Create a macro to Count words
* Create a macro to Loop through Folders  
* Create a macro to Loop through Files  
* Create a macro to bind everything together and output  
  
This uses hardcoded Masterfolder. Your Excel file can't be inside the Masterfolder. My Masterfolder is C:\Temp\WordFiles and every folder and file is below this folder.  
  
Continued below.



OP needed a solution, it was provided, the problem was interesting, but one of the Mods, /u/epicmindwarp, who obviously is a pro at Excel, provided a solution sooner than others. And now the post is downvoted.

Keep it up, /r/excel community, great spirit.
I will make this for you later today as currently I am at the airport.

PM me your email please so I can send it to you later.
Create a new project in VBA (Alt-F11 again) and just paste this in:  
Macro 1:  
    
    Option Explicit

    Sub get_wpm_errorcount(ThisDoc As Object, itemNumber As Integer, LastLine As Integer)
    'Dim ErrorCnt As Integer
    Dim WordCnt As Integer
    
    WordCnt = ThisDoc.Range.ComputeStatistics(wdStatisticWords)
    Cells(LastLine, 4).Value = WordCnt

    End Sub  

  
Macro 2:  
  


    Sub Demo()
    Dim fso As Object 'FileSystemObject
    Dim fldStart As Object 'Folder
    Dim fld As Object 'Folder
    Dim fl As Object 'File
    Dim Mask As String

    Set fso = CreateObject("scripting.FileSystemObject")
    Set fldStart = fso.GetFolder("C:\Temp\WordFiles") ' <-- Change your Master folder here

    Mask = "*.docx"
    Debug.Print fldStart.Path & "\"
    ListFiles fldStart, Mask
    For Each fld In fldStart.SubFolders
        ListFiles fld, Mask
        ListFolders fld, Mask
    Next
    
    MsgBox "Done!"
    End Sub  

Macro 3:

    Sub ListFolders(fldStart As Object, Mask As String)
    Dim fld As Object 'Folder
    For Each fld In fldStart.SubFolders
        Debug.Print fld.Path & "\"
        ListFiles fld, Mask
        ListFolders fld, Mask
    Next

    End Sub  

Macro 4:  
  

    Sub ListFiles(fld As Object, Mask As String)
    Dim fl As Object 'File
    Dim FileCount As Integer
    Dim LastLine As Integer
    Dim wordApp As Word.Application
    Dim wordDoc As Word.Document
    
    FileCount = 0
    
    For Each fl In fld.Files
        If fl.Name Like Mask And Not fl.Name Like "*$*.docx" Then
            LastLine = Range("A65536").End(xlUp).Row + 1
            FileCount = FileCount + 1
            Debug.Print fld.Path & "\" & fl.Name
            Cells(LastLine, 1).Value = fld.Path & "\" & fl.Name
            Cells(LastLine, 2).Value = fld.Name
            Cells(LastLine, 3).Value = fl.Name
            Set wordApp = CreateObject("Word.Application")
            Set wordDoc = wordApp.Documents.Open(fld.Path & "\" & fl.Name)
            Call get_wpm_errorcount(wordDoc, FileCount, LastLine)
            wordDoc.Close (wdDoNotSaveChanges)
            wordApp.Quit
            Set wordApp = Nothing
        End If
    Next
    End Sub  
  
Let me know if you have any questions.


Eh, no need to upvote the post now, it doesn't need any exposure (if anything, downvoting it ensures the "ongoing" threads have higher visibility). It'll still turn up in future searches regardless of downvotes, that's what matters!
People also downvote it to reduce visibility i.e. if less people see it, then less people are working on it, i.e. more likely that they will get there first.

But it's not an issue, the post is at +2 now.
Sorry, got someone one the case already! No need to waste your time, but thanks!
Darn, just before you replied /u/epicmindwarp sent me a blank Excel file by PM where I just had to plug in the path and it did everything automagically. Way easier than copy/pasting macros in VBA. Still, I'm sending you 3 months of gold for your efforts, thanks a bunch!
I was curious as to how this worked and tried to reproduce your steps with a new spreadsheet and copying the macro's into VBA however it threw up a compile error for me on the first line of macro 4.

The error is below and i'm using excel 2010 in case that matters.

User-defined type not defined

    Sub ListFiles(fld As Object, Mask As String)

I was wondering if  /u/epicmindwarp would upload his result so others we could see how their working result was built.
This works on Networkfolders as well as I can see in your screenshot.  
You can use Excel itself to format the Foldername to a date if you need to (SUBSTITUTE(A2, " ","-"))
Any chance of sharing the file? 
Nice! /u/epicmindwarp; must be nice to have a file handy. Or did you create from scratch?   
No worries - I learned a lot this morning in the 45 mins this took me, and that's my goal for 2016 - learn something new everyday!  
  
Thanks for the gold!!
> automagically

automagically > automatically
Ill see if I can help you tomorrow at work.
Which macro did you try to run?  
I'm calling Demo() from the Sheet (ribbon - Developers - Macro's).
I had the initial loop to hand, added the second loop, and then had to write out the connection to word - so it was a bit of both!

Learned something new too!!
I was going to delete the thread, but who knows, it might turn up if someone searches for something similar in the future, and your code will probably come in handy :-)
I got it working, for some reason even after doing this step
> Reference Word application in VBA (Alt-F11, Tools, REferences, search for Microsoft Word x.0, check)

It decided to untick the box, however closing excel, reopening VBA and re-ticking the box worked.

Great solution thanks.
Hey man, any chance you can post publicly what you sent him so others can benefit from this question? 
I dont see his answer posted. Did he DM you? If so, do you mind sharing because I could benefit from this as well.
Nice, good job!
I was referring to the series of macros above, which - presumably - do the job. I'm not comfortable sharing the file I was sent in a PM, since it was paid work and therefore not mine to give around.
