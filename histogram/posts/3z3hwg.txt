Who has experience with Power BI?
Work in it every day.   Been doing power pivot since 2010.  Best product Microsoft has ever released for data.
Just started playing around with it. Love it so far. Trying to put a plan together so my company can add a content pack to the growing library. 

Anyone have any tips in that regard?
I've been playing with it for months now. It's a Tableau killer. 

The ability to load open source charts from the gallery paired with the data fetching capabilities of power query is HUGE. 

They have hundreds of improvements in the works as well.

Just think about the integration with Microsoft's platforms..
I think they will have a SharePoint embed capability soon enough. 
This is going to have some huge impacts on business data viz. 
Power BI is the same as what's in Excel 2016. They incorporated it into the new version 
I've been working in this space for over 20 years - roughly 10 years on Cognos and 10 years on SQL Server Analysis Services.  I expect Power BI will likely be the dominant platform for the next 10 years, at which point I will hopefully be retiring or at least slowing down. I've done a few successful projects in it already and everyone wants more.

Microsoft (to their credit) made a huge bet on rebuilding their BI platform starting 5 years ago and have been methodically putting the pieces in place.  Tableau etc would also have to rebuild their products from scratch to compete in the medium term. It's more likely they will just try to milk ever higher profits from an ever shrinking user base.

For training, Microsoft have recently posted a series of tutorials on their YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/user/mspowerbi

As Power BI is relatively new, blogs etc are a bit thin. Try searching for power pivot or dax (the Power Pivot formula language).  The Forum on the Community site gets very quick, high-quality responses.

Also note that you can do a lot of data transformation in the Power BI "Edit Queries" UI.  This is descended from the "Power Query" add-in, now embedded in the Excel 2016+ on the Data Ribbon.  This layer has it's own formula language, sometimes called "M".

PowerBI is different than power pivot. Your answer suggests you might not be aware of that. It is a common mistake, one that I made for a while.

You can download the designer for free and there are plenty of videos out there.

And of course the power bi website is here:

You are correct.  I should have been more concise with my language. I have been working in power bi every day since it's release this summer,  but I have also worked in DAX one of the languages of power bi for 5 years and power query since it's release.  I have worked in the components of power bi, for as long as they have been released.
