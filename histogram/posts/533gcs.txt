Create a check-box that will send an automatic email? is this possible?
Hello,  

You can create a macro in VBA attached to a check box or a button that will send an email of your choosing when run.  

    Sub Send_Email()
        Dim OutApp As Object
        Dim OutMail As Object

        Set OutApp = CreateObject("Outlook.Application")
        Set OutMail = OutApp.CreateItem(0)
        With OutMail
            .SentOnBehalfOfName = ""
            .To = ""  
            .CC = ""
            .BCC = ""
            .Subject = ""
            .Body = ""
            .Attachments.Add ActiveWorkbook.FullName
            'or
            '.Attachments.Add ("C:\test.txt")
            .Send
            '.Display can be used if you wish to open outlook before sending the mail.
        End With
        Set OutMail = Nothing
        Set OutApp = Nothing
    End Sub

Just simply enter your desired text and addresses inside of the quotation marks. You can also remove the .SentOnBehalfOfName field if you are not required to send from a standardized mailbox, and wish to use your default Outlook address instead. You can also change .Body to .HTMLBody if you wish to enter hyperlinks in your message.  

Hopefully this helps!
thank you works well!
