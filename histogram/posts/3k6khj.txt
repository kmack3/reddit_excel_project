How do you use Excel to improve your life outside of work?
[deleted]
I look for difficult questions on /r/excel and try to come up with solutions.

Building spreadsheet solutions is sort of a 'lateral thinking' version of standard programming. Which is not to say that programming is easy, per se, but when you've got an entire programming language (Python, C#, etc.) to use to solve a problem, there are comparatively far fewer constraints.

When all you've got is a few worksheets and some formulas, you've got to MacGyver your way through it.

I enjoy the challenge.
I use it for budgeting my personal expense. This year has been rough and I've been handling all the bills/rent for the house so I set up a report which takes all my expenses and basic debits/credits to see if I can survive another day. I made one for my cousin as well and threw in vba code which asks user for annual salary+expected expense which he happened to love and now thinks I'm a genius hah.    
    
I also use to use it to keep track of song names or notes by implementing  IFTTT commands so when I text a certain number or email a specific line it will add that to a cell for future reference. You can use this to keep track of weight (great a graph for visual) or just as a backup contact list.
What is this "life outside of work" I keep hearing about?
Wow, where do I begin... I've got a spreadsheet for nearly everything I track in my life. For example, I do triathlons every summer. How  do I choose among the dozens of races in my area? I make a spreadsheet comparing each race of course! I compare entry fee, distance from home, swim length, bike length, run length, use those numbers to calculate my expected finish time, compare that finish time with last year's winners, etc.

I also have a spreadsheet that tracks my personal net worth, and another one for my budget. A Google spreadsheet that tracks stocks (in order to make use of Google's Googlefinance function to get live stock data). Another spreadsheet tracks my health, where each row is a new day.

Pretty much any time I have some information I want to record, I put it into a spreadsheet so I can sort and filter the data easily.
RPG Games. I have used what I know to help make game concepts, modify existing character sheets to better fit my needs, and even whole sale build my own. 

It's great to use a work skill to better a hobby. 
We were 7 kids at home and only my father was working, we had a very low income/person to live. During some years, my mom used Excel spreadsheets to compare the cost of food in supermarkets around us, and entered many recipes to make shopping lists... After a while she stopped doing it - it was too much work for the benefit it represented, but I guess it helped her at least find out which supermarket were cheapest for the range of products she needed... 
My friends and I get a big beach house once a year. When deciding on locations, we usually end up with a lot of back and forth about which ones are best or most cost effective, etc. So I make super-thorough charts and graphs to show how much each one would cost with different numbers of participants, etc.

They give me endless shit for it, too. So I love organized data. Fuck me, right?
I use it to help me manage my little league teams. Rosters, parent information, and my stats.  Team hitting for each player. Sortable by the game or the player.   
Just made a weekly meal planner that shows in data bar graphs the calories and the macro breakdown (protein, carbs, fat) of foods I want to eat for the week versus what I actually require. I like to be able to visualize how I can play around with the food so I hit my daily targets. I really need to rein in my weight / calorie count / macro count and I believe planned and prepared meals will get me there.

Hadn't been able to find an app that lets me do this adequately so I made one in excel. Making this made me finally understand what VLOOKUP does haha. Inputting food manually is a pain though, but I believe that over time I'll have a database of my favorites and would no longer need to do this as much.
It's small but I use them for fantasy football. Makes things easier and also keeps me a little sharp.
Our finances are all done through Excel. We track every pound we spend
Budgeting and what we've spent our pennies on each month. This includes a Pension sheet, a Mortgage sheet (including graphs to show where we are), Student Loans sheet and a total net worth sheet.

I then have a weight sheet going back several years, tracking how my weight has changed. Added to that now is a running sheet, giving avr pace, miles run etc.  This has been great to track achievements and be sensible about how far I am running weekly, as well as keeping motivated. 

We are improving our house, so I've measured up each room and created a plan of each in excel. This is done by making all cells say 20 pixels x 20 pixels and then using this grid as 10cm units. So I have a nice plan of the relative size of each room, and can decide layouts and what we can fit into each room. It has been useful when buying carpets or looking for furniture, and playing around with what we want to do.

I'm an accountant, so as long as I am playing on Excel I look as though I'm busy at work :)
Aside from the household budget and basic analysis (phone plan selection, etc.) I have one vaguely interesting use.

My friend created a turn based star wars game in C.  Essentially you use funds to buy ships and then break them into attacking and defending fleets and send them against other players.  Blowing shit up got you more funds.  We had about 8 players and did one turn a week, coordinated over email.

Originally everyone was left to their own devices to manually watch their fleet and finances.  They'd have to check it against the GM when they sent in their buy and attack orders.  I created a spreadsheet that automated parts of fleet management, making out much easier and faster to do your weekly buying.

I also created a space Catholic empire run by the lizard Pope, though not with excel.
I use Excel for my personal finances.  I don't use it as a check register but more of an expense/bill/income tracker.  I have a file I keep in my dropbox so I can open it from work, home, mobile, etc. if I need to.  It has the following: 
 
DASHBOARD - I don't really use this.  All it really does it take my monthly income, add receivables, subtract payables, subtract off average bills for the month, and then use that figure to estimate how much longer until my personal loan will be paid off.

CALENDAR - I black fill the days as they go past, might put due dates for bills on the calender, paydays, etc, I really just like to mark of the days for the most part though.

BILL AVERAGES - Chart with all my monthly bills: insurance, rent, electric, gas, etc.  Gives me averages for the month and I can also see what bills were last year for estimates on gas/electric.  Since they fluctuate with season, the previous month isn't reliable.

INCOME - I use this one the most, it is essentially my true 'dashboard'.  On this sheet I have a section of every paycheck date throughout the year and when I know how much my upcoming paycheck is going to be, I record it there.  It keeps an average for year after year.  I get paid every other week (26 paychecks per year), it tells me which two months I will receive three paychecks, and how much my total income for each month will be based on average paycheck amount for the current year.  I then have charts for each paycheck.  In these sections it has the amount of the paycheck, receivable amounts, and left over amounts from previous paychecks.  I then have which bills I will pay with that paycheck and I can see how much I will have left over to pay toward my loan.  There is also a small paycheck estimator where I put in my current salary, and new salary and it will estimate my new paycheck amount based on the average tax rate.

RECEIVABLES - I use this to track who owes me money.  It could be something I bought for work that I will be reimbursed for or my gf's half of the bills, etc.  These numbers feed back to the income sheet.

PAYABLES/DEBT - I put my loan balance in here.  If I happen to have a balance on my credit card.  If I owe someone money it will go here.  I don't use this sheet very often except to update my loan balance.

LOAN - This sheet tracks my personal loan.  I record payments on my loan here and it tracks how far ahead on payments I am and estimates when I will have it paid off in full.  I can also put in payments that I want excluded from the calculations (Christmas/Birthday money, etc).

IRA PROJECTIONS - I record IRA contributions and my gain/loss for each day.  At the end of the month it will be recorded to the month, and new daily figures will be recorded.  Same applies for when the year is complete.  I have it set so I can estimate my average return and contributions for the future and when I plan to retire.  It calculates a projection for what I will have when I retire and how much I will be able to use per year based on an estimate of how old I will live to be (100.  Come on medical technology! haha)

NOTES - Just that.  Notes.  Nothing here related to calculations, just reminders I might need.  Rarely used.

RETIREMENT CALCULATOR - This doesn't tie in to any other the other sheets, just something I was working on.  Inputs include:  current age, planned retirement age, life expectancy, current savings, planned yearly savings, estimated gain percentage, estimated inflation percentage, option to increase contributions with inflation, and what interest rate you plan to receive after your retire (by moving to less risky investments).  It crunches all the numbers and tells you how much you will have when you retire and how much you will be able to withdraw per year so you will spend the last of your money right before you die.  Womp womp, sorry kids, haha.

I have been using it since 2011 and modify it over time whenever I see a need.

O yea... I also have a stock market tracker that records historical costs and analyses them for indicators to buy particular stocks.  I eventually want to have this running/refreshing on my home computer and have it email me alerts of what to buy.

I also use excel for fun problem calculations like proving the Monty Hall Problem by running 100k tries and adding up all the individual digits from 1 to 1,000,000 (not 10 + 11 + 12, etc, but 1+0+1+1+1+2, etc)
My life outside of work is a glorious mess! I try to keep spreadsheets out of it and enjoy the chaos. 

More seriously, I've just used excel as a paper with a built-in calculator for doing budgets, especially when moving, expected income, expected expenses, cross reference with actual expenses once every month or two, nothing too crazy. 


Use excel to track performance variables for Olympic weightlifting for different athletes, with an idea that an increase or decrease of certain variables will warrant for an increase or decrease of training loads for given athletes (trying to predict if an athlete may be entering overtraining).
I use it to list expenses - budgeting for a trip mainly or for a hobby project. I really only benefit from the date formats and sum function.
I use it translate and sort Japanese baseball stats into English. Lots of COUNTIFS (for team win-loss, team vs, run differential, monthly W/L records, etc), vlookup (to bring back the English name of a player), =([cell#]&" - "&[cell#]&")" to put numbers in parenthesis in the order I want, and RANK, MATCH to automatically sort top leaders in certain categories. I also just push one button to update a whole bunch of stats from a website and translate the names automatically, so I can just copy the data here to reddit.
I am a very serious/competitive fantasy baseball player. Excel is awesome for creating projections, player values for auction, and all kids of statistical goodness. Back in 2004 when the whole sabermetrics thing started to take off I used Excel a ton for regressions and stuff like that. I'm not a wiz at it by any means but it's a really good tool and has a steep learning curve (meaning easy to learn). Fantasy sports is the #1 reason I use Excel, and #2 would be costing/analysis for the company I work at. I actually started to use it for fantasy hockey analysis and despite not knowing much about the players themselves, I usually have very little trouble being the #1 (or close to it) team every year in a league full of hockey nuts, just by being better at player valuations based on other peoples' projections.
I pay for everything when I'm out with my friends on weekends and send around a "Cost of Memories - A Final Analysis" doc the next week, which is always unnecessarily complicated. 

Takes away a the headache of splitting checks, gives me something to do at work on Mondays, and I get the points on my credit card. 
**TL;DR** - I made a spreadsheet that tracked simple metrics for my life.

One of the commonly used tools in software development is a set of automated unit tests.  Basically, each unit test is a simple check to make sure that a piece of code is operating properly.  In a large software project, a team will write thousands of these tiny tests that just check to make sure everything is on track.  These tests would be run on a regular basis to make sure that if something in the code breaks or things start getting messed up then you're aware of it right away so that you can take steps to address the problem.  It's a bit of work to set all this up, but it means that you have fewer bugs in the long run.

I decided to apply the same type of principle to my life and I wrote down a bunch of "tests" for my life - things that would indicate whether or not things were on track.  I called them personal unit tests.  They were all pass or fail and each day I would put a 1 or a 0 down for each one.  There were about 20 in total, organized by category (Health, Life in general, Goals, and Work).  Some examples:

1. I've exercised at least 4 times in the last 7 days. (Health)
2. I've made progress in whatever book I'm reading within the last 3 days (Life).
3. I slept at least 6 hours last night (Health)... etc.

I put it all in a spreadsheet, added some graphs, made a few calculated cells for the ones that track "I did something *x* times over the last *y* days", and then started updating it every day.  I compared those numbers against my overall well being and found (generally speaking) that days where I did 15/20 or better I felt great and days that were below 8/20 I felt terrible.  It was a simple, quick test to make sure things were on track.  If they weren't then I could pretty easily tell where things went sideways.  It took about 5 mins per day maximum.

I found it very valuable.  Eventually, the things on the spreadsheet became habits and the need to continue tracking them became less and less, but I think I tracked these things for about 2 years in total.

I used to play in 2 poker leagues and various home games and kept track of money spent (game buy-ins, bounties, etc.) and winnings. When the profit/loss dipped into a negative balance I would play fewer home games until the profit increased. This kept my casual poker playing profitable. At the end of each calendar year I moved the balance to a savings account. Eight years of playing, every year I had money to transfer.
I theorycraft the shit out of anything I can in games I play, so there's that
Outside of work for me is mostly working on my startup and other projects. I use excel a lot for formatting social media posts: reddit included.

There's a lot you can do with concatenate, such as formatting tables in reddit or other long strings including various bits of information like dates, times, locations, prices, etc.

If you maintain a inventory in a spreadsheet, then you can create social media posts that include relevant information when posting about it using concatenate, vlookup or index/match. If you have a scheduler, you can batch post things saving a ton of time.

Most recently I created a formatting spreadsheet for terms and conditions that I need to make every so often. I have a friend for dates, times, relevant item, and some other info, and then all I do is copy and paste the column where all the html spits out from a series of concatenates.

So... technically outside of work for me, but it really is just more work. However, it makes my life easier where I want it to be.
Budgeting my monthly cash balance, keeping track of monthly house expenditures and savings and such. 
I use spreadsheets for everything!

But most often it's for fitness related tracking.  I have a run log that allows me to easily input my runs in both distance and duration and it calculates pace for me which then feeds to a chart which will show my pace over time (line chart) as well as distance over time (histogram) overlaid on top of each other.  This has been great as I ramp up to marathon training for a marathon in October.  Plus I love seeing my progress over time, keeps me motivated.

Another one I use daily is for weightlifting and body weight tracking.  I notate my daily weight & body fat % and it generates a chart of weight loss over time and body fat over time as well as calculating my lean muscle mass.  I use this same spreadsheet to my major compound lifts as well.  It tracks the weight used then the reps per set and displays two separate graphs; 1) increase in weight to determine PRs and 2) total strength (reps x sets x weight). 

I'm a very visual person and I love seeing my progress displayed in a nice chart to see how far I've come and keep myself motivated.
I use Excel for a variety of things, including personal budgeting and analyzing cell phone plans and other bill-related items.

My biggest use is for my Pokemon card collection though. I export my collection from my Access database when I need to manipulate the data or to provide a template for other people to use. 
MMO in-game trading. It actually helped me learn excel more than my work. I use a spreadsheet to find out what item will yield me a profit, just like how some people use excel to track stocks.
I'm not sure if this qualifies as life improving but I use Excel in conjunction with other life aggregators and analyze my life.  For instance, I will export my iTunes library to a CSV or XML and summarize it for friends and family by sharing what artists are most popular, least played songs, songs that were popular but have not been played recently, common bit rates, etc.  My friends tell me they loved the graphs.  Another fun analysis was exporting all text messages from my phone and then analyzing the ebb and flow of texts exchanged between contacts over the course of years.
Congratulations on keeping clean
I realize this has nothing to do with excel.  But I am so enamored with the fact you use the current tense.. "I am an alcoholic and drug addict"

My brother got out of rehab a few months ago and I'm worried about his mindset on his addiction.  Too soon he was claiming that "he believed that he would be one of the few addicts who goes on to lead a totally normal life" and would pat himself on the back for "only having 5 beers and not wanting to do cocaine or drink anymore after that".  
Excel is the best computer game ever made.  It is perfect.   
Agreed. It's also easier to hand off a spreadsheet with formulae to someone rather than a program, which requires maintenance that the user may not be able to maintain over time.
This is a great point I've never thought of. There are so many tools and libraries out there for Python that you can do almost anything by just adding a library or something something of the like. 

With Excel, you're given a few lemons and are asked to make lemonade. 
So glad guys like you are around when the users like me who can only ask for help and don't have the knowledge to add contribute any answers ourselves, need help yet again
I can only think of retirement...
I'm unemployed.  You sit and look for jobs all day.
Could you share some more about the health tracking spreadsheet?

Do you do regular medical exams? Is it only about weight? Do you track diet

I'd love to see the header or a sample.
Would love to see your workbooks for this!
I did that for about a week, then I found Gamechanger app. It is fantastic for little league. The kids love seeing their stats and you can usually pawn it off onto one of the parents to do alongside the score book. If you don't have time, you can then just use a copy of the score book to enter after the game. And finally, what really kept it fun was it can post straight to twitter with summaries of the inning which the kids parents and families liked of they couldn't make it to the game! 

I swear I don't work for game changer...

> Inputting food manually is a pain though, but I believe that over time I'll have a database of my favorites and would no longer need to do this as much.

I've done something similar where I have a master sheet with all foods and nutrition templates (food names, macros, etc) get updated every time master sheet has been modified. Feel the pain regarding entering foods, it becomes especially painful with multi-ingredient recipes but I think in the long run it really makes you aware of the kinds of foods that go into your body. It'd be handy to scan the bar code with your phone and the existing master sheet gets updated (I've seen this implemented with a few apps already, but the food data base is different in different countries so the app ends up guestimating the amounts).
Oh yeah!
Would be interested to see what this star wars game is like. 

> steep learning curve (meaning easy to learn).

that's the exact opposite of what that means
I think i might just do this with my roommates... 
False
Cheers.  It is easy now.  Definitely think the spreadsheet helped!
One of the main challenges to getting clean, is admitting the problem to yourself.  There is no softening the blow.  I am an alcoholic and drug addict (crystal meth, and diazepam).   I rarely say this out loud or tell anyone because I live a clean life of sport, study and healthy eating, but when I do, even though I am clean, it still makes me wince.  I can totally understand the way your brother thinks.  He is not clean though and is still using, no matter how he chats it up. Sorry to say. 

I wish him the best, but the only way to solve the problem is to get off it and stay off it.  No other way.  

Sorry if this is too off topic for an excel based group!

Relevant XKCD: https://xkcd.com/353/

What is this "retirement" I keep hearing about?
Yeah I have columns for when I woke up, each meal, what medicine I took, what sort of workout I did, any sort of pain I experienced, and when I went to bed. Like I said, each row is a new day. I actually just created it recently, trying to match some unusual pains to my diet or exercise to see what might be causing it. 
I love th GC app.  (THere are a few issues that bug)  But I prefer to add data to a spreadsheet and building a chart or line graph to report out the history of a players a BA or OBP. The only data I use is the only data I enter.  unlike the GC app which gives me too much information (for 11 year olds)
You could add functionality to deal with country differences...
I'll see if I can dig up some of the documents my friend that made it sent around.  All I remember is that I started out well but my base was severely damaged by a surprise A wing swarm.  The next week someone came in to finish it off and all I left was a Mon calamari cruiser and a super star destroyer (with a Vader hero character attached).  At that point the Catholic church became mercenary.
It's usually used incorrectly, which is why I specified *easy to learn*. Think of a graph with ["learning vs time"](http://i.imgur.com/xNaLXOt.png) with a steep curve, and think about what that means.
Well they will flirt with you to do stuff for them
