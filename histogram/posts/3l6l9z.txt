How do I convince my office, full of baby-boomers who are generally not excel savvy, to upgrade from Excel 2007?
Who pays for it?  Latest office isn't cheap.  Not staffs choice normally.
Prepare a short, to-the-point presentation about the benefits of upgrading. Pick examples specific to a specific person and use them as a direct example of how productivity will be improved.  Their enthusiasm for the upgrade has to be on a similar level as yours for anything to happen, so you need to give real examples of how it's going to improve their work environment. 
If you could actually show that the benefits of upgrading out weight the costs of upgrading, then they would have a business reason to upgrade. 

But, if as you said, few people in your company actually use the advanced features of 2007, and considering they may need new computers to run the latest version, it really might not be worth it.

Maybe instead you could focus on just getting upgrades for the power users, rather than the whole office.
Show them slicers. 
If they do, the Beatles will re-unite.
We're still using Office 2003
2013? You want to be ready for 2016 baby, check out these graphs man

Upgrading from 2007 to the latest version may not have a lot of benefits.

2003 to 2007 was a jump imo. 

If they are still on 2003 or older, then perhaps tell them to upgrade. 
Don't bother trying to get them to upgrade, you can't win that discussion. What they have works fine and is free (paid for). Try to justify buying an upgrade for yourself. 
Just upgrade to 2010. They won't notice the difference.
the chart defaults are so much better. i used to waste so much time changing the colors of lines. they are acceptable enough now that i don't bother changing unless it's for repeated use
To them 2007 wasn't a long time ago - just a short 8 years.  
We run multiple versions.  Let the old people flounder with their old software while the handful move forward to 2013.  You will have a few see the benefit and ask for upgrade and the rest will slowly fade into oblivion.  
You don't need to convince the whole office that a core set of people need to upgrade - just the few people who control the purse-strings.
Sadly you are probably in a company, like many others.  The real answer is, you need Microsoft to release office 2015.  That way companies can upgrade to 2010 safely, and still be 2 versions behind.

For the life of me, I don't know why my company went with 2007 just as 2013 was rolling in.  I can see not jumping to 2013, as it is so much more different with the default layouts, but 2010 is essentially a bug fixed 2007, with additional features, and customization, if you can find them... /shrug.  I suspect 2013 just happened to come out around the time QA and UAT was finally completed, and I suspect our company has a policy of always being minimum one OS and Office behind.
I'm going to go a different route than everyone else here: 

Sell them on Office 365.

There's a couple different ways to do get them to buy Office 365 licensing, but you'll need to identify a bottleneck in their IT department or in the company that can be solved with Office 365 Business or Enterprise. 

Talk to your IT guy and just do an exploratory, "Have you ever heard of Office 365?" Let him look into it. If he asks why just say something along the lines of, "I hear a lot of companies are using it, I'm wondering if it's on our roadmap." "What do you think about it?"

Then, go find a Microsoft Partner to talk with your IT guy, I can help with that, or you can search around online. 

With out a doubt there's a business problem that Office 365 can help solve, it's just a matter of making your employer realize they can save money or make money by doing this move. 

Then you'll have Excel.
You should have seen getting people to upgrade from 2003.  
Why would you continue to waste your talent at that place?
Tell them it's end of life, end of support or nearly so.
The worst thing I found upgrading, was relearning where the start button was and the menus. 
Do you have dual monitors? You can have 2 windows open at once in 2010 without running 2 instances of excel. 
Good luck, I was the oldest in my office by a couple decades and I was the only one who had fun with excel or powerpoint. The other staff always came to me to help them out when they screwed up (often).
i mean there isn't **that many** extra features you can't do really, it's a big cost for just one staff member to make utility of
What do they do for email? Move everything to office 365 and then you can use office 2016
Millennial here. 2007 is the shit. Totally enough in my opinion and we do pretty much all our tax before forms, planning, compilation and write up in it. And that was upgraded from 2003 just last year. Unless more than a few people are going to use the new features often, and the features actually make work more efficient, I see no justification for the expense.
Show them how you can make charts, pivot tables etc in one click in 2013.
Power view :)

Tell them 2007 is end of life so they have to upgrade.

You are in need of reviewing the toilet-paper calculation.
I don't think money is the issue here, its more about a desire to learn the new features. 
Is it? I thought businesses usually paid yearly licensing.
This is probably the most doable and least risky option here. The only problem I see is a desire to learn the new features among department heads. Many of these people are happy with the way they're doing things, and even after showing the superiority of some features, they may not even care. The "Don't fix what isn't broken" mentality. 
Not a terrible idea. Is there perfect backwards compatibility? In other words, if I use powerpivot and then send the file to a 2007 user, would everything work ok?
How would I show them slicers without having the upgrade? 
[deleted]
Hah. Perhaps making good jokes is the best strategy I have!
Ouch. 
Yes....Yes! I'm ready! :D
Exactly. The folks spending the money are running a business and are trying to make money, not spending it without getting a return or benefit back. If there's not a measurable, quantitative analysis clearly explaining how the proposal will be in the company's best interest, there's not much else motivating the business to endure the expense. If no one else would benefit, I'd look at OP like he was crazy for expecting several hundred or even thousands to be spent for his sole improvement. 

Message here is to only ever pursue your ideas to help improve something until you can no longer clearly document and prove how the benefit will directly outweigh the costs and inherent risks, and always try to think like an owner.
I don't think I have the administrative capability to change/install new programs onto the network. 
If I could somehow show them the advantages compared to what I'm currently doing, then it might help. But I'd need to use a newer version to do so. Youtube videos won't sink in, I think. 
Yes, but my only concern is whether the people who fade into oblivion will be able to use files that are using the newer features. If I use powerpivot in a file and then send that file to a 2007er, will it still be functional?
So we get to repay for the same product every year? Sign me up!
Actually, it's the best job I've ever had. Excel isn't everything. 
That's nice. I'm used to running two instances, but that will save a step when going from one instance to the other. 
I mean I can already do it in a few clicks...alt,n,v,t
I have sympathy if you have office 2007, but in 2010, there is no excuse, you can customize it.  It takes a little work, but worth it.

All that said, I think that visual studio has been context sensitive for ages helped matters a bit.
What commanders were lost between 2003 and 2007? Just asking honestly. I prefer keyboard commands for repetitive tasks and don't feel I lost anything.

I agree that the transition was painful between 2003 and 2007. Most common thing I heard was "it's gone" or "I can't find it." But google is a thing so I found my way through. Some things are hidden in seriously un-intuitive places though. 

The keyboard smasher for me is when you need a ribbon tab and that tab is hidden until you click in a certain place...
I'm not trying to piss people off or impose any costs. I like my job. 
Why does everyone have to upgrade? My giant company multiple versions are available if approved. 
Create a report using some of the key features that came with 2010. Particularly,  a Slicer dashboard with Sparklines and the new conditional formatting(data bars etc.). Add some advanced pivot/table filtering,  and possibly find all the stuff that they use frequently and have to dig for and create a custom ribbon for them(or add it to the quick access). See if power pivot / query works for what you do,  that could win them over.  Find other awesome new features to include in that,  I bet outlook added some nice stuff too. I'm not too sure what all new stuff that came with 2014, but 2010 was a pretty decent step in my opinion. 
why do they need to learn the new features?

the existing stuff works the same...
I think your barrier to entry here is not so high.  They're probably thinking back on the last time they upgraded: 97/2003 to 2007.  That was a colossal change with the introduction of the ribbon with a huge initial learning curve for things everyone thought they knew how to do already.

2007 to 2010, 2013, or 365 doesn't look much different as far as the general user interface.  There will be a little learning curve to using the new iteration of the File menu.  But should be relatively minimal.

Positioning the business case for the upgrade would then be: for most of you, this change will not affect things.  For people or departments X, Y, and Z features A, B, and C will increase productivity by [obviating this other software / increasing the amount of data we can process / giving us additional analytical power via PowerPivots / increasing security of password-protected workbooks by removing the hashing exploit / etc. etc.].

You've got to do some homework to fill in the blanks at the end though for the few folks in your group who do use the updated tools.
Have you looked up how much the upgrade would cost for your company for 2010 and 2013?
Some Office apps have a bit of trouble regarding layouts, and design, but as long as you save it as a file from the old versions (xls instead of xlsx), it should be fine.
Install powerpivot on all 2007 machines. It's free, so why wouldn't you?
No, it's not perfect backward compatible.  My office just did what you want to do.  I'm you, but seeing what has happened we'd be better off just sticking with 2007.

Youtube video of slicers.

You pretty much just described my company: older people that are extremely knowledgeable about the industry and processes and some young people who are tech savvy who will take the company to the next level.
Please, I run 97 at home. Unlimited licenses baby.
Doesn't that make the entire process pointless?

They won't realise the difference until they try it themselves. With stubborn people, you just have to force them to use it.
others have said this but i'll just add that changing versions probably won't do much to improve productivity of your coworkers. i would focus on making the argument to your IT staff. most people use excel (and computers in general) as a moderately sophisticated form of paper. that mindset is pretty hard to change and as an analyst (?) it's not exactly your responsibility to change it. 

tbh i've not used any of the features in excel 13 b/c i never use pivot tables. is it a really big improvement?
Not really, the total cost of the product is more expensive off the shelf than buying a subscription. Right now on Amazon *Office Professional 2013* is $170 for one computer, or you could buy for $8.25 a month through O365 for 5 computers. That $8.25 includes 1 TB of file storage on OneDrive and versions for 5 tablets. 

It's extraordinarily less expensive to buy O365.

As I said in other comments, backwards compatibility of features was my fear. But if that's not a problem, then I agree with that approach.
If I'm going to be using the new features, then they need to know that what I'm doing is correct and valid. Hence, they need to have somewhat of an understanding. 
In a public company that has millions of dollars worth of assets, cost is less important for software upgrades. 
Ah, this would work! Thank you!
Only way I see this idea working is if I make a video of myself using 2010 and doing certain important assignments in both. So they can see the difference. 
Make sure to upgrade all your formulas and macros/vba work that involve the time or data functions.  I went through the transition to office 2000, and it did break some things.
These people are rational enough to respond to incentives. That's what I'm looking for, not a way to shove it down their throats. 
You can actually create a completely customized ribbon as well in 2010, I can't recall if it lets you add icons to the bases, but in the worst case you can call any of the functions via a macro which you can then assign to a keyboard shortcut.

It would take about 1 afternoon to a day to learn how to set up a keyboard short cut and get it to work with macros and buttons etc.  The only reason I say a day, is some of the functions would be a bit more tricky re: modifying what the macro recorder creates.  I guess you could do the keyboard shortcut part of it in 2007 as well, but I like the custom ribbons at home.
2007 and 2010 are nearly identical. The only difference is the huge file menu button in 2007 that was replaced with the green file menu on the ribbon and having better preset charts. The major changes from traditional menu to ribbon were between 2003 and 2007.
Yes it costs money to upgrade--not just in purchasing the product, but the time it takes to install and train employees.  It is this training that current employees don't want to take, and it costs the company money.  You need to show them that *not* upgrading costs the company more money.  Show them how upgrading can:

a)  Save the company money in the long run by perhaps doing things faster/more efficiently).  This will make the strongest argument for your case.  **edit:** don't just casually state this--carry out some kind of analysis/case study with actual numbers that will prove your statement.

or

b)  Improve the quality of the existing work, making it more appealing for clients.  This is a making a harder case, as it is not easy to gauge the monetary benefits of this.  So it's not easy to directly compare it to the monetary costs of the upgrade.  But if already can make case a) from above, then you include this as well for a stronger case.
It was a low effort comment on my part, but numerous people have told me how much they love the slicers in the reports I've built. There's a lot more benefits to office 2010/2013, but that's one that seems to resonate with people who stick to their old ways. 
It was mostly a joke. I haven't used 97 in a long time.

I was thinking slicers as well.  sparklines are probably the other.
I think he said they were concerned after the 2003 to 2007 change over.
