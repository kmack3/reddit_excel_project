Dowloading File and automatically reformating
Hello. So I will love anyone who helps me solve this. 

I have a file that I download every day from the same site that gives me updated information, however, I have to go through and delete like 15 tabs every day and edit where certain things are. Is there a way for me to have this automatically reformatted when I download it? 

I think if I save it as a new name or something I might be able to...

If not automatic are their other options I have?

Please Help!!

Record a macro of you performing this task and then play it back every time you want it...

Can I record myself downloading a file from the internet? I have figured out how to do it by resaving it under a different name and then opening that worksheet, but that's as close as I have gotten to make it automatic.

No, you cannot record the downloading part but you COULD record the other operations.


- If you want to record the ENTIRE operation, you'll need to move up to using Power Query. 
- I would recommend this since you have no prior VBA experience anyway.

If you point me at the right site I could assist you further...
