Csv help
I need to delete the top two rows of multiple csv files and then add a column with the name of of the file for every row please help.

VBA or power shell is fine 


-------------
    Option Explicit
    
    Sub FileManip()
    
    Dim sPath As String, sFile As String
    Dim lf1 As Long, lf2 As Long
    Dim sLine As String
    
    sPath = "c:\path\here\"
    sFile = "myfile.csv"
    
    lf1 = FreeFile
    Open sPath & sFile For Input As #lf1
    lf2 = FreeFile
    Open sPath & "Temp_" & sFile For Output As #lf2
    
    Line Input #lf1, sLine
    Line Input #lf1, sLine
    Do While Not EOF(1)
        Line Input #lf1, sLine
        sLine = sFile & "," & sLine
        Print #lf2, sLine
    Loop
    Close #lf1
    Close #lf2
    If Dir(sPath & "Temp_" & sFile) <> "" Then
        Kill sPath & sFile
        Name sPath & "Temp_" & sFile As sPath & sFile
    End If
    
    
    End Sub
  

Be sure to amend the path and file variables as appropriate
