Adding Data to a Pool
Hey guys

I have pool of data, for example

    1
    2
    3
    5
    6
    8
    9
    10

When I receive new data such as, 4 and 7, I want to insert a line above the 10 then sort the data.  However, sometimes I will have to add new data like 11, 12, 14, 15 ... etc

Question is, how can I make a macro that will count the new data and add it into the data pool.  Duplicates are OK.


-------------
Why do you want to insert it above 10?
-------------
Can you clarify a bit?:
Do you mean you want to add new data (from wherever) into the line above 10? Or do you want to add the new data together first, then insert above 10?
-------------
Just as a work around.  Say I have Cell A10 name AEnd, if I insert something above that, the cell name will stay the same, but will now default at cell A11, which I'd want
-------------
I want to add the data above 10 as a workaround.. I have the last cell named so i can pull a range.. if data is inserted after the 10, it will not be included without more modification
-------------
So learn to use tables instead.

- the tables expand when you drop data at the bottom of it (or in the middle)
- you can determine the length, width and column names easily.
- you use table column name references instead of old-fashioned cell references.

Ok I think I understand. I'll try some things when I get home.

So when adding a table, i am able to insert data in.  Now my question is, how can I compare the data in the table with the data I receive and only add the ones that do not already appear?  At one point there may be 3 new items.. another there might be 5 new items

I would have used .removedupes before, that's why I said it wouldn't be a problem

    Sub Macro2()
    Dim TableList As ListObject
    Dim TableRow As ListRow
    
    Set TableList = Sheets("Table").ListObjects(1)
    Set TableRow = TableList.ListRows.Add
    
    TableRow.Range(1, 1).Value = "Z"
    End Sub

This is my code so far - simple enough ... I'd want to change "Z" to the new letters that do not already appear in the table, excluding the ones that are already in the table
-------------
Typically, you'd get the size of the listobject and simply drop your new data in the cell UNDER the bottom left corner cell.

- table grows to include this data.
- any calculated columns (containing formula) copy down into the new row.

You might find it easiest to calculate that cell OUTSIDE of the VBA in a cell (which you give a name to) and which you access inside your VBA. 

      =Range("nextCellToFill").value
