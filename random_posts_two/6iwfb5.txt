Dealing With Data Loss And Avoiding Reference Errors
I am not sure I worded the title correctly, but here's what I'm trying to do: 

&nbsp;
 
I am working on a spreadsheet that shows the progress of Employees individually and the team as a whole over the course of a year. I have five data pieces per employee: "Calls Presented", "Calls Handled", "Calls Wrapped", "% Wrapped", and "Handle Ratio". Currently I have each employee set up as a set of five columns across the data sheet, and the Team Total as another set of five columns using a =SUM Formula to gather the first three, and the same formula as the individuals for the last two.

&nbsp;

My problem is two fold:  
1. When I have turnover, and I delete the employee's columns it causes a reference error. BUT I still want to maintain their data just in a different location; what is the best way to do this?   
2. When I have new hires I have to insert them and manually add their cells into the =SUM Formula, which can get tedious, especially during periods when I have high turnover. Is there a way to make this automated?

&nbsp;

I am using Excel 2016, I am open to using Macros though would prefer not to. As far as skill level goes I am probably somewhere around intermediate.

Can you please just change a name or two and show me what you mean?

- I don't understand what you mean by "delete  the employee's columns." Surely you delete the whole employee row, no?
- What kind of reference error and where? Are you highlighting cells and doing right click delete? That's the issue - just hit the delete key and delete the contents.
- this should just be using an excel table - with calculated columns. When you add new employee data on the bottom, the calculated columns are automatically added to each row. Total rows can be added.

All this summing could be done in a pivot table. You could also use it with a slicer to enable display of different views.

An OLD database problem. Don't delete columns. Instead, enter employees' data elsewhere, then pull in CURRENT employee's data into the individual employees columns you want to show and sum those columns.

Table in Reddit form below.  
1. I have the employees as Columns with dates as rows, I felt this was the easiest way to manipulate the data.  
2. The reference error is in the =SUM Forumla under "Team Total", yes I am highlighting cells and right click delete. The main issue here is that when an employee is no longer with the team because I add data weekly to the sheet it adds to the workload because I have to ensure that I'm inputting data under the right employee rather than keying through quickly.

Would using Cut solve the issue of deleting the columns?

The fairly typical error being made here is trying (and failing) to both capture AND present the data in ONE sheet.

- split data entry/capture into a separate table.
- summarise data in another table (Pivot works perfectly for this).
- slice your pivot table to filter down to the data which is important at any one time.

Not reliably.

So ultimately the data is being presented as charts as individual employees and then a team chart. Though I would like to be able to set it up so that you could compare two different employees on the same chart.
