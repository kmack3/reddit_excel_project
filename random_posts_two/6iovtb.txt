How to combine values into one total based on cell value
That title makes my head hurt.

So, what I'm trying to do is figure out a way to have a list of items with no duplicates and then pull the quantities from a report where there *are* duplicates into a total of quantities for all the items.

This for example is a report of the data I have. Duplicates make me have to go line by line and count, and in my *actual* report I have thousands of different items. It's not just A, B and C.

Item | Quantity
---|---
A | 9
A | 32
B | 2
C | 6
B | 0
C | 3
A | 12

This is what I want to create as quickly and painlessly as possible:

Item | Quantity
---|---
A | 53
B | 2
C | 9
