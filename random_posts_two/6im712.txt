Pivot Table - any way to have a column show a percentage of another column?
I have a pivot table summarizing call data.  

My data rows are the various staff members that take the calls.  I am trying to capture the following in my pivot table:

* total # of calls (I'm counting the date column - working)
* # of callers that book an appointment (I have a column w/ Yes in my table for any calls that book - working)
* % of callers that book (I want this column to show the percentage of bookings relative to total calls for that staff member - not able to get this working).

I understand how to format the field in the pivot table to show the values as a percentage of the column, etc., but am stumped at how to reference this percentage as it relates to the total number of calls.  I see options for Base Field and Base Item when determining the "% Of", but I'm returning #N/A for every variation I've tried.  Is it because my source table has Yes in the column I'm trying to count?  Do I need to add another column in my source table that uses a 1 for any records with a Yes?

Any help or suggestions are much appreciated.

Absolutely this is possible. You need to use a calculated field. In the ribbon select Analyze>Fields, Items, & Sets. Then choose calculated field. Name the field what you want and in the formula selection you can use the fields as listed to do you calculation. In this case =bookings/callers

Thank you for the reply.  I wasn't able to get it working with the way my original data was formatted, but once I converted my Yes/No data to 1/0, I was able to get the calculations working.

One follow-up...  When creating a calculated field in a pivot table, is there a way to specify a sum of the fields used rather than a count?  It seems to default to count which throws things off if I use a 0 for No/False values.  If I delete the 0, it works correctly.

Right click one of the values in the field. Select summarize values by. Then choose sum.
