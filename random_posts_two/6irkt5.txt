I have an excel sheet with some data, I need an interface which asks for a primary key, goes to the excel sheet, fetches the data and prints it to a word document template, which, I have kept ready before hand.
It should have a vanilla interface, which any naive user can use. 


-------------
If you were to create the template in Excel itself, simple references could be used to the chosen record's data - and you could print from there...

- The "key" is used to identify which row of data to use, right?
- make a table of the source data, use data validation to create a look up list of keys
- search for the key in the source table.
- reference the other data in the source table using the previously looked up row.
- template fills itself in
- choose the template cells as the print area 
- hit print (it works, take a look...plus I centered it on the page)

Here's the example file.

Is there any way I can take that output to a word document?
-------------
Yes

- You make a default word document, 
- copy the cells you want 
- paste AS LINK/Excel worksheet object.

Changes in the excel should be reflected in the word document (and right click -> refresh to force it)

Fine I'll try this! Thank you soo much man!! 
I appreciate this (:
