Finding Duplicates with different attached data
Hello r/excel, first time I post here after subscriibing, I am sorry if the title is not descriptive enough but I really cannot think of a better way. It's best I just describe my problem.  
  
I have an excel with names of customers and the market segment they are booked under:

As you can see, some customers, like "James K." are booked multiple times, under the same or different market (2x Chicago, 1x New York).  
  
What I need is a list of all clients who are booked in more than one segment (does not matter how many times, just how many segments, and which).  
  
To be clear, what I would expect for this example is a formula that tells me that:  
*James K. is booked in two segments: New York and Chicago.*  
  
Non duplicates are unimportant.  
  
Any ideas? Thank you in advance for helping a noob.

A pivot table would do that analysis for you - is that on the table as a possible solution?

You could arrange a pivot with the traveller's name as the rows, and use "count of zip codes" as a value to give you the number of segments each person is booked in. 

To get the actual segments themselves, you could either make the list of segments a Column value, or use them as Rows values *underneath* the traveller's name.

That would provide the information, though in a different format to what you're envisaging, if that's not a problem.

Edit: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/2SPA4) is an imgur album that shows the arrangement of the fields, and what the output could look like.

You can make helper column D, paste this into D2 and then copy and paste it down:

    =COUNTIFS(A:A,A2,C:C,"<>"&C2)>0

Checks if the name in A2 appears again in column A but in a different market than C2 ie that person is booked somewhere else. If there's multiple bookings then it returns TRUE. If not, FALSE.

Then you can filter the data based on column D to only show you TRUE values, sort the table by priority A and then C, and there you go: all the multiple bookings for a person and in which market.

I hope that does all you needed!

This is kind of a start, but the count is irrelevant. What the OP is looking for is clients with more than one *unique* market. 

'James K' is easy(er) to spot in the pivot table, but it's impossible to exclude the other clients. 

The real need here is *distinct count*, which is not available as a direct formula in Excel. There are various work-arounds, including using fancy formulas (e.g., [here](https://exceljet.net/formula/count-unique-values-in-a-range-with-countif) and [here](https://exceljet.net/formula/count-unique-text-values-in-a-range) ). Also, workflows are described [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Count-unique-values-among-duplicates-8d9a69b3-b867-490e-82e0-a929fbc1e273).

Yeah, I suggested the pivot because it would get a person close enough to the answer to see it, without being particularly complex.

If OP has very specific output requirements, then a simple pivot won't do.
