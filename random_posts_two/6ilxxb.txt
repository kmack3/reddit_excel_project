Change location of chart using VBA
I am trying to change the location of the graph that I generate with my vba. For now, it is just taking data from a column that may or may not change size. I understand I do not have 'Chart1' identified ion my code but I can not figure out where to declare it where it doesn't create another sheet for the chart as well.


    reportsheet.Select
    ActiveSheet.Range("a4", ActiveSheet.Range("a4").End(xlDown)).Select
    ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddChart.Select

    With ActiveSheet.Shapes("Chart1")
       .Left = Range("A40").Left
       .Top = Range("A40").Top
    End With
