Help with VBA (possible VLOOKUP) code to match TWO column text then copy row and paste to new sheet.
Hi guys,

Pretty new to VBA and I've been searching Google for an answer but haven't had any luck so far.

Here is an [image](http://imgur.com/a/yRBfi) of my spreadsheet. Basically I'm trying to write some code that would find all "Used" with "0" and copy the row and paste to a new sheet. The only problem is that all the "New" have "0" too.

Hopefully you guys can help me out here. Let me know if you need more info and I'll do what I can.

Thanks in advance.

SOLUTION:

    Set ws = Sheets(1)
    For i = 2 To ws.Cells(Rows.Count, 2).End(xlUp).Row
    If ws.Cells(i, 4).Value = "Used" And ws.Cells(i, 10).Value = "0" Then
    matchRow = Rows(i)
        Rows(i).Select
        Selection.Copy

        Sheets("No Photos").Select
        ActiveSheet.Rows(i).Select
        ActiveSheet.Paste
        ws.Select
    End If
    Next i

What do you currently have written?

You want to loop through your records, and check two cell values.

    If ws.Cell(x, 4).Value = "Used" And ws.Cell(x, 10).Value = "0" Then
        Do Stuff
    End If

Honestly I don't really have anything written yet, it's part of a larger macro I'm creating. I'll give that a shot though, thanks!

What does the 'x' stand for? Just any row?

> If ws.Cell(x, 4).Value = "Used" And ws.Cell(x, 10).Value = "0" Then

Hey, so I tried combining this with a similar code I had written earlier and came up with this.

    If ws.Cell(x, 4).Value = "Used" And ws.Cell(x, 10).Value = "0" Then
        matchRow = Cell.Row
        Rows(matchRow & ":" & matchRow).Select
        Selection.Copy

        Sheets("No Photos").Select
        ActiveSheet.Rows(matchRow).Select
        ActiveSheet.Paste
        Sheets(1).Select

    End If

Any idea why I might be getting "run-time error '424' object required"?

Thanks again for your help.

x would be a variable for your loop. You'll want to look through your records, something like below:

    For x = 2 to ws.Cells(Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row
        Do Stuff
    Next x

You'll need to define ws. It is a worksheet object. Something like this:

`Set ws = Sheets("enter sheet name here")`
