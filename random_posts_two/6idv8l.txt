Corner Case and Margin Case Testing for VBA
Do you have examples of corner and margin case tests, specifically for user inputs, via text box in user form or InputBox? Max values for Long and Integer are the classic cases. 

I've recently been reading about sanitising inputs in SQL (think XKCD) and next thing I know, I was deep inside Wikipedia.
