How do I change from an unwanted number format, to one that I want, and then strip off all formatting?
Hi guys. Right now I have a column of data that is formatted as GENERAL. In the formula bar, it displays data as a decimal time of "0.0035419900938863" which I gather is actually associated with a date and time. This number formatting came to me from someone else after they had subtracted two timestamps. What I'm interested in is only the difference in seconds. So when I simply change the number format to "ss" I get the number that I want which is 51 seconds.  
However, the cell itself is still formatted as custom "ss" I need to forward this data to a mapmaker who can only receive the data formatted as general. So my question is: How do I strip off the formatting right now as "ss" to be "GENERAL" while still cell and formula box both read 51? In other words, I don't want the cells to have any formulas or formatting. I just want the # of seconds.  
Thanks for the help.

So this should be easy, but the specific numbers in the post don't quite make sense.

Excel stores time in units of days `0.0035419900938863` is 0.0035419900938863 x 24 x 60 x 60 = 306 seconds. Note that is 5 minutes, 6 seconds. Which is why if you format as `ss` you get 06. But that's not what you want: `ss` chops off any time you go over 60 since that's minutes (format as `mm:ss` you get `05:06`).

TLDR: Your data is messed up, but chances are you want `=A1*24*60*60`.

Note 51 seconds is 51/(24\*60\*60) = 0.000590. [As seen here](http://i.imgur.com/HXxN2Yr.png)

If you have a lot of them in a column, the quickest method is to

1. copy the formatted seconds to notepad
2. delete the Excel data and format the source cells to General
3. copy paste all those values back from Notepad.

Also note that to show seconds over 59 seconds, wrap the `ss` in square brackets `[ss]`

I used your tip of multiplying by 24* 60* 60. And then used the other comments advice with notepad to remove all formatting. Thanks so much! Marked as solved!

Yes! This is exactly the solution I needed. I used the multiplication from the other comment to get it into seconds. And then your suggestion to strip off all formatting. Thank you!

You do not need to use the multiplication with this solution, copy straight from the value where formatted as `[ss]`
