remote employee monitoring
We have employees that all work from home as phone agents. Our calls are slowing down and I am assigning customer lists to each employee. The lists are an excel file consist of customer info that each employee looks up via our web based software. 

I have them enter a "1" in column F when they have completed the customer. 

Is there any way I can remotely monitor their progress? Most likely they will not be using the browser based excel. 

Thanks for the help!

I'd recommend switching to Google Sheets if you want to see the updates live.
-------------
You can't get live but I think with a shared workbook you can set updates to 5 minute intervals. It's probably not an ideal way to go though as shared workbooks are troublesome. 
-------------
You could autosave updates to a network share, or even do some basic file manipulation to send updates at regular intervals to a log file.  Alternatively you could probably do something like the code below to send of an update to you, but it might not be very efficient:  

	Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Excel.Range) 
		If Target.Column = 6 Then 'Column F
			ThisRow = Target.Row 
			If Target.Value > ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Some Hidden Sheet").Range("A1") Then 'Checks total count of column against previous total
				doevents 'send off update to network share your code goes here
				ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Some Hidden Sheet").Range("A1") = Target.Value 'Update total
				Thisworkbook.Save 'Saves the update
			End If 
		End If 
	End Sub

good luck!

This is the answer.

if you're referring to a macro that saves the sheet every 5 minutes - let me tell you my tale with shared workbooks and auto-save/auto-close macros.....
Not everybody is smart enough to click on the "Enable Macros" button on the highlighted yellow bar at the top of the program.

100% agree. If you want live up to date information use Google Sheets.
