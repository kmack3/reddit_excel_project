Change Worksheet Shortcut Issue
Hello /r/excel,

I just got a new computer with Microsoft Excel 16 and I am having trouble using the shortcut 'Ctrl' + PgDn/PgUp to change worksheets in a workbook. It instead just brings me to the bottom/top of the current worksheet. How can I remedy this issue?

Thank you

Do other keyboard shortcuts work, like copy and paste?  If others seem to work fine, it might be that the keyboard command for change tabs was incorrectly assigned.  You can do this one of two ways, go into options, then go under customize ribbon.  At the bottom there should be a button for keyboard commands.

If not, you can search for it in the search function using help (F1).  I've been reading that some keyboard commands in 2016 aren't working and that you can't edit the commands at all. Not sure if Microsoft will fix this but I would look through your program to see if you're missing it.
