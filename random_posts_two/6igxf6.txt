Looking up a min value in a table without ifs statement.
I swear I've seen an nice clean way to do this using the table, but I can't remember / find it.  It's not a big deal in this situation, but it is driving me nuts and will come up when I have more than 4 criteria.

All I want to do is look up an employees years of service and return the weeks of vacation they are allowed (table below).  So, if they have worked 5 years, they get 2 weeks, if they've worked 10 years they get 3 weeks, etc.



Years | Week
---|---
1 | 1
3 | 2
7 | 3
15 | 4




-------------
`=VLOOKUP(YearsOfService,A1:B8,2)`

Where A1:B8 is your years-to-weeks table
-------------
That's going to return #N/A for the in between years of service like 2, 4,5,6,8,9...

Did you try it? Or are you just assuming :)

Ha!  I did try it but out of habit, I put "True" at the end.  Why does leaving true / false off make this work?
-------------
The default value is "TRUE," so if left out, it assumes to TRUE. "TRUE" performs an approximate match -- the function finds the first value that's higher than the lookup value, then returns the previous row. It's perfect for tables like this (as long as they're sorted)-- and grades, tax brackets, commissions, etc

I guess I never wanted approximate matches.

Thanks.

And I think we both switched around or true and false.  False returns the exact match.

Oops, good call, will edit my comment for the lurkers
