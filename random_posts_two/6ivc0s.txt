Conditional Formatting for a cell being equal to another cell
Column H contains quantity ordered, Column J contains quantity received. If they do not equal each other, I would like them to both highlighted. If that is not possible, than just having 1 column with highlighted values would work too. Is this possible? I'm new to conditional formatting I apologize if it's a simple answer.

If you go into conditional formatting, you can format via a formula, using the following formula

    =if(not($h1=$j1),1,0)

then highlighting the appropriate regions, or just putting in

    =H:H,J:J 

in the Applies to area, it should highlight based on the format you select when creating the rule!

By selecting H:H,J:J it might highlight your headings as well, so maybe selecting using

    =h2:h10000,j2:j10000

it would work better!

I understand how to create a condition with a formula. I do not understand the "Applies to Area" part. Am I looking for somewhere to input that area of H:H and J:J, or is it part of the formula?

PS: Is your username Runescape related?

Right now the applies to area I've defined as H:H,J:J which means that it's going to look in columns H (that's what H:H means) and J (likewise for J:J) and apply this formula to those areas. I put $ in the formula so it doesn't shift over, and it'll evaluate the same formula regardless of the horizontal shift!



I had one that a while ago, this one however isn't though

Ok I understand now. After inputting the formula you gave me though it just highlighted all of column H and J.

You might have to change my original formula, depending on if you want to highlight cells that are the same or are different!

I would like the cells that are not equal to each other to highlight.
-------------
then use the formula

    =if($h1=$j1,0,1)

This should work!

Going to have to apologize. I pasted my values from a table, and only column "I" didn't format to a number format. I converted it to number format and now your original formula works correctly, thank you!
