Using vlookup when table covers a range of values
I have a table that says, up to 50000 = 80, up to 150000 = 120, up to 225000 = 170.

So if my original value is say 175000 how do I get it to automatically reference the up to 225000 part of the table. I have it working for most of the table using nested if functions but there are too many for the full table so after a point I just have the cell say 'calculate manually'.

Is there a way to assign a range of values, i.e. 0 to 49999.99 to a cell?

I apologise if I've missed this in the sidebar or any incorrect formatting.

Ps. Trying do the whole table in the way I have currently returns a too many functions error.

Thank you for help.

Yes. Make a table like this  

|   | A      | B   | 
|---|--------|-----|
| 1 | 0      | 80  |   
| 2 | 50000  | 120 |  
| 3 | 150000 | 170 |   

Then `=VLOOKUP(Value,A1:B3,2)`

What does your if statement look like?  I put together the following:

=if(value1>=cell(150000),cell(170),if(value1>=cell(50000),cell(120),cell(80))

(Just pop in the cells that point to the values in my example)

What this will do is check to see if value is bigger than 150000 and if so, assign it 170 - otherwise, it'll check to see if it's bigger than 50000 and if so, assign it 120, otherwise, it'll assign it 80.  If you use that, it shouldn't return a "too many functions" error.

I'm using a table drawn using a webquery though, will this not be overwritten when it refreshes?

Put this reference table in a separate location such as on another sheet. Put the VLOOKUP formula in a spot that won't be overwritten by the webquery (i.e. where your existing formula is). Not sure what you mean.

Thank you.
