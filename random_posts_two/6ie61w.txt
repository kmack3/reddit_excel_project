MS Project to Excel VBA
As part of my job I have to copy and paste data from MS Projects into Excel to run a report. It's tedious and time consuming. Does anyone have any example VBA code that can pull data from MS projects and copy and paste it into Excel?

Ideally I'd have a button in excel that could be pressed to "refresh (wipe and replace the data)".

It can be done - I built something to do this (I did it for my employer so I can't share directly)

Basically you need to declare some variables like this:

    Dim MyProject as MSProject.Application
    Dim myTasks as MSProject.Tasks

Then you can open the correct file and assign it to MyProject and then assign the tasks to myTasks:

    Set MyProject = MyProject.ActiveProject 
    Set myTasks = MyProject.Tasks

Then you can loop through the tasks like this:
 
    For Each t in myTasks
       ...
    Next t
