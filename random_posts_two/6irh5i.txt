Add distinct count to existing pivot tables
I have a large spreadsheet that has more pivot tables than I can count. I would like to use the district count feature in one of the pivot table fields for most of the existing pivot tables. As far as I know the data model check box must be selected when creating pivot tables to be able to select distinct count. Does anyone know how I can get distict count without recreating all the existing pivot tables?
