How to assign a value to text for the use in drop-downs
I want to create a drop-down, but instead of the actual values displaying I want to display text that represent numbers.

For example, I have created a drop-down for Apple, Orange and Pear. When clicking on the drop-down you see the names, but they represent 1, 2 and 3 which can be used in formulas. I tried VLOOKUP, and IF function but that didn't work.


-------------
I would think nested a IF formula and a helper column would work, but I would need more information.

 =IF(Cell="Apple",1,IF(Cell="Orange",2,IF(Cell="Pear",3,"")))

This is one option.

Depending on how many values you have, you could just have a text dropdown, then a vlookup from that text to a value. You would have to build the reference table first (unless you have one). You could return this value to a hidden cell, or formulate off of it.

I have tried this method, but it only displays the value. I prefer to display the text, but behind the text it "represents" a value.

I don't know how to do this. Care to explain?

Understood, but that is where a helper column comes into play.  Assign the value to a helper column to use in formulas.  You can hide the helper column(s) or put it on another worksheet.

Create a dropdown in cell A1
[Create a dropdown](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/microsoft-office/how-to-add-a-drop-down-list-to-an-excel-cell/)

In another sheet, list your text in one column, and values in another

    Apple     1
    Orange    2
    Pear      3
    etc....

On your first sheet, go to cell B1, and type the formula

    =VLOOKUP(A1,Sheet2!A:B,2,FALSE)

You now have the number in cell B1 that is referenced based on the dropdown

FYI - Sheet2! is whatever you name that second sheet

Thanks, it worked!
