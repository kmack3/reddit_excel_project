How to get different price estimates based on the items in the drop down menu?
Hello there, I seem to be stuck on this particular part, I might just be approaching it wrong. I need help on how I can link different values to the drop down menu using different equations based on the different types of panels. I added four screenshots below. I'm super new at excel and this is my first Reddit post. Thanks :)

Index match the cell you want to display the information.
