Phase in revenue based on ramp up percentage
I am trying to build a revenue forecast model that takes the number of sales reps and multiplies by a known average of revenue per rep. The problem I am having is building in the assumption of a delayed "ramp up" time - so for example, in month 1 of employment, a rep might hit 25% of quota, 50% in month 2 and so on.
 
My model also has the reps being hired in different months, such that I start with none, then each month add 1 or more additional reps. 
 
I have it set up so that the revenue comes in based on when the rep is hired, but I haven't been able to figure out how to phase it in based on a variable "ramp up" percentage per month. I want to avoid hard-coding so that I can adjust the % for each ramp up month and have it change for all the reps.
 
Any ideas?

Is each rep on their own row, with # of months they've been working?

Each rep has their own row and a start date. 
 
My thought was use some logic around the start date that says:
 
- Subtract start date from current month (in header)
- If the result is 0-30, use the "month 1 ramp up percent"
- If the result is 31-60, use the "month 2 ramp up percent"
- and so on

The downside there is I would need to nest an IF for as many months of ramp-up factor as I want to include.
 
Any other potential ideas that would be cleaner?

You can do it by days or months, up to you. If days: 

Make a table somewhere with the day # that each percentage is achieved. i.e. 

|   | A  | B   |
|---|----|-----|
| 1 | 0  | 25% |   
| 2 | 30 | 50% |   
| 3 | 60 | 75% |    

Say this is on a sheet called "RampUP"

To reference these values, use `=VLOOKUP(TODAY()-StartDate,RampUp!A1:B10,2)`

This will return 25% if in day 0-29, 50% in days 30-59, 75% in day 60+. Add/modify the table as needed.

Perfect, thanks!
