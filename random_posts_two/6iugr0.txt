What is the name of the method I would use.. Marco?
Forgive my newbness.
I have a spreadsheet 3000 rows, about 8 columns.  The data is generated from a report.  I run the report weekly. 

I want to be able to run a few formulas in succession to clean up the sheet to be ready for further processing..

I will be adding new data to the existing spreadsheet in an effort to capture new rows, and changes to certain values.

things like
1.compare new data against existing data, and bring over complete new line for unique entries.  also bring over 1 column from every other line.
2.Delete entire row if it has certain key words in it.
3.add 2 columns, and populate them with sums and percentages.
4. color code a cell if a value has gone up or down.

what would be the best way to accomplish (most of) these tasks easily?
thanks!



-------------
Macros (so, VBA code) were made to do that. Excel has been moving a lot towards data processing with Get & Transform (Power Query prior to 2016) which I believe can also can do this. There's a nice graphical front end, then a whole language ("M", so not VBA) behind it that you can edit.

I would probably do VBA myself, but I've done VBA before and there's a huge library of support (100 other people have done exactly what you're trying to do, at least any one particular step) via Google.

*edit*: Meh, M doesn't seem to have loops... so yeah, VBA.
