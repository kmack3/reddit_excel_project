Creating Macro that automatically Refreshes All Data
I want to create a macro that will refresh all the data that is being "Pulled from web" across all spreadsheets.


-------------
Use the recorder
-------------
Yeah I could, but that gets messy, like it shows (albeit microspeed) switching between sheets and cell movements
-------------
That's easy enough to fix. After recording it just wrap the code in this:

at the beginning

     Application.screenupdating = false

Then at the very end

     Application.screenupdating = true

-------------
great thanks!
