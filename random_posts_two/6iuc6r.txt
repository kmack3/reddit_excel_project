Consolidate and sum rows
I have a spreadsheet of insurance claims. Each row represents one claim. A given policy (with a unique policy number) may have multiple claims on it, so it will have multiple rows with the same policy number. I need to create a report with a sum of the claims for each policy. I imagine this would involve the "consolidate" function but I can't seem to make that work. Any advice or a tutorial you can point me to?

LOL, you will love me after this.

1. Create a pivot table
2. Put whatever data you need in the pivot table (claim and total, likely)
3. Put the policy in the filter
4. Go to Pivot Table Options, click Show Report Filter Pages
5. profit

Or just put the policy in the pivot and dont parse it out

Your best bet may be to include a helper column that sums each row then you can use SUMIF with the policy number being the criteria and the total'd column being your sum range.

Why didn't I think of this?! This is exactly what I need to do. Thanks.

[SUMIF](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/SUMIF-function-169B8C99-C05C-4483-A712-1697A653039B)

     Syntax: SUMIF(range, criteria, [sum_range])


You use the SUMIF function to sum the values in a range that meet criteria that you specify.
