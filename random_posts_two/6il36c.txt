Have Vertical information, Need horizontal results.
Hey guys, I have a question that I do not know how to solve


the thing is, I have columns and a simple sum in one spreadsheet, and I need to present it horizontally in another one


so I Have
='Received per source'!BE158   and one I drag it right, instead of going to BE159 it goes to BF. How do I change that? 

I mean, I don't want to manually input 200 lines of changing a number, there must be a way!!



Sorry if my english is not that great, and thank you, excel-fu fighters





Thanks y'all, you are awesome â™¥

Do you need to do it once? There's copy-paste with transposed option. Otherwise if you want something that updates automatically you'll have to do something more rafinate (trickier but not impossible)
-------------
Use `=INDIRECT("'Received per source'!B" & column(FB1))` to generate the range and drag across, adjust the column reference to start on the correct row.. i.e column FB is column 158.
-------------
Can you copy, and paste special with transpose?
-------------
    =INDEX('Received per source'!$BE$158:$BE$358,Column(A1))

Is a non-volatile alternative to excelevator's solution.

Hi!

You have not responded in the last 24 hours.

**If your question has been answered, please change the flair to "solved" to 
keep the sub tidy!**

What is the love affair this sub has with indirect? Offset and index and so much nicer and more efficient to work with. Indirect should be a last-ditch method at all times.
-------------
Why do people always ask rhetorical questions instead of making a point?

Why would you pop in to r/Excel to make such a comment considering your zero record of assisting in this sub?

We are all learning here, and today I was reminded about INDEX from u/Passeri_ which is another option in solving OPs issue.


-------------
I see it used often but I think it's a bad practice. So I was pointing that out in case people has an explanation.  And I have helped in this sub, I just wasn't given points.

So make a proper reply, not a snipe on a reply.
