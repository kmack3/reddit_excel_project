Which DAX formulas should one learn first and are the most useful?
So far it seems that SUM, SUMX, CALCULATE, FILTER and RELATED are the most used. Maybe someone could tell, which ones do you use the most?

(just like you probably start learning 'standard' formulas with IF or VLOOKUP)


-------------
Those are some big ones. Whichever you use, http://www.daxformatter.com/ is a great tool for keeping the overview in the formulas you'll write.

Also, this is a very open and therefor impossible question to answere. I remember learning most by just Googling - and almost always ending up reading blogs of Rob Collie on powerpivotpro.com
