Search as you type for dropdown list
I'm trying to create a drop down list that allows the user to type and filter the drop down list to only show items containing that string. I've tried using a combo box but it only has autocomplete and doesn't filter anything.

Looks like [you can do it with ComboBoxes](https://www.extendoffice.com/documents/excel/2401-excel-drop-down-list-autocomplete.html#a1).
