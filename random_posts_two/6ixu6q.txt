VB copies row for me, how do i delete it if source is changed?
Hi there,
I've got a VB that, if sheet 1, Column A contains the word "Urgent", it copies the entire row to the next free row in sheet 3.  So far so good.

Sheet 1/Column A is data validated to be either blank, Urgent or Upload Required.  How can I change it so that if I change from Urgent to either of the other options, it will delete from sheet 3.

As a bonus, I'd LOVE to have it so that in addition to what it does already, setting Sheet 1/Column A to Upload Required, it does the same copy, but to sheet 4!

I know I'm asking a lot,but you guys are so good at this that i've become addicted.

This is what I have so far:


    Option Explicit
    Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim nxtRow As Integer
    'Determine if change was to Column F (6)
     If Target.Column = 1 Then
    'If Yes, Determine if cell = B
      If Target.Value = "Urgent" Then
    'If Yes, find next empty row in Sheet 2
       nxtRow = Sheets(3).Range("A" &             
    Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row + 1
    'Copy changed row and paste into Sheet 2
        Target.EntireRow.Copy _
          Destination:=Sheets(3).Range("A" & nxtRow)
      End If
     End If
    End Sub

Hey,

Copying over to the next empty row is one thing, but deleting a row where we don't know its location or the cell's prior state is another. First thing is you'll need to know what the value was before the change, so worksheet_change is no longer going to cut it, next you'll need a unique key that IDs the record for deletion. 

If this is being done manually probably a combination of worksheet selection change and worksheet change, or with a clever use of application.undo to get its prior state. 

Then simply search  for the corresponding key in your other worksheet with range.find and delete that row.

As for the sheet4 thing, just replace sheet3 with sheet4 and Urgent to Upload Required in your existing macro. 

Watch out for loop firings of events, use application.enable events or set a Boolean variable to control them. 

Hope this helps

Can I add the sheet 4 thing while keeping sheet 3 thing (sorry to be so technical)?  Ideally I'd want it to do both functions

Haha fair enough, yes here's your macro but adjusted for the sheet4 thing: 

    Dim nxtRow As Integer
    
    If Target.Column = 1 Then
        If Target.Value = "Urgent" Then
            nxtRow = Sheets(3).Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row + 1
            Target.EntireRow.Copy _
            Destination:=Sheets(3).Range("A" & nxtRow)
        ElseIf Target.Value = "Upload Required" Then
            nxtRow = Sheets(4).Range("A" & Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row + 1
            Target.EntireRow.Copy _
            Destination:=Sheets(4).Range("A" & nxtRow)
        End If
    End If

Just expanded the if test to include an ElseIf, that performs another test for Upload Required should the first test return false. 

Also, i'd add another test  to your macro to make sure 1 cell is changed as this will return a mismatch error if someone tries to change more than one cell in column A at the same time... or alternatively increase its scope to be able to handle multiple changes at the same time (a little more complicated)

thanks
