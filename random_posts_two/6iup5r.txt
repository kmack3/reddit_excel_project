Using solver to schedule workers - optimization help
Hi, I am trying to use solver to optimize a schedule given various constraints. That is the easy part. I am maximizing points given the points assigned to each staff. A nested IF works. I searched on this subreddit and found some nested IF solutions but none that apply. 


The problem is there will be 100+ staff. So a nested IF will be too long. Solver will assign who works which days with at least two people per day. The points total would be the maximized goal. How do I make the points total per day though? If the day is selected by "1" then how do I make this one cell lookup that persons point value? 


The solution doesn't have to total the value at the bottom per day either. It could total the entire "grid" aka month, if that is easier.


Thanks in advance

Assuming "points total per day" is the sum of points that correspond to the  people working that day, `=SUMPRODUCT(C5:C9*$A5:$A9)`.

That's easy as well. `=SUMPRODUCT(<whole-month-range>*$A5:$A9)`.
