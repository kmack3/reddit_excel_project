How can I use an Excel sheet as a desktop gadget in Windows 10?
I know that desktop gadgets have been discontinued in Windows 10, but applications such as Rainmeter allow you to have widgets/gadgets on your desktop. I'm looking to have a spreadsheet on my desktop because it allows me to take down notes, make to-do lists and works as a calculator.

Just a thought, never tried. There seems to be a software called AutoIT script and some users manage to keep an application 'always to the bottom'. Then you could open Excel and just pin it to the bottom.

But then why don't you use two monitors? With extended desktop, you should be able to drag Excel to one screen and do your work on another.

Definitely doesn't have the power of Excel, but OneNote can do all those tasks and it can be docked to your desktop.

Upvoted because I'm quite interested in this feature. I hope you find a solution

With RainMeter, I think it'd be easier to read a txt or csv file which are more structured and you can edit in excel or easily export from excel.

Zhorn Software makes THE BEST stickies software ever. And it's free.

I do something very similar to this using a program called Autohotkey. 

Basically, it allows you to write your own scripts that you can assign to keyboard shortcuts. 

I have a shortcut that opens up excel, notepad++, opens up Firefox and four separate tabs and a stack load of other things.

To do this:
1. Download and install autohotkey.  This installs a compiler which turns your script into an .exe file. 
2. Write the script for all the things you would like to do. 
3. Load the script into the autohotkey program. 
4. Run the executable that it creates.
5. Enjoy. 

If you want to get adventurous, you could even create a .bat file and open it at start up so the executable begins at start up and fires up what you want.

I have spent the last couple of months increasing my efficiency at work and home using autohotkey, it's awesome!
