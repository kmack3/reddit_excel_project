Trouble with Countif. Trying to get a value if two columns are non-blank
Trying to get a sum of all the values where two of the columns are filled. An Example of this would be:

A | B
-|-
X | y
X | y
X | 
X | y
X | 

In this case I would like the count to be 3. I have tried the following: =Countif(a:a,"x",b:b,"y") but I get a "Too many arguments were entered". Is there a different function I should be using or is there a way to fix what I am doing? 

I am using a 2013 mac version of excel if that is relevant and I will only be using this function once a week or so.

How about:
    =SUMPRODUCT((A2:A5<>"")*(B2:B5<>""))
-------------
COUNTIFS
-------------
>  =SUMPRODUCT((A2:A5<>"")*(B2:B5<>""))

That worked! The only thing is its counting the title of column as well. How would I make it only count the x and y marked in each cell/ exclude the title?

Edit: Ended up just shifting the range from a2:a1000. Hopefully wont get a thousand data points but if I do I'll have o remember to fix the range.

Would you kindly reply solution verified to my post to give me a clippy point? :)

Happy to have helped.
