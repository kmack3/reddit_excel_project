Creating multiple horizontal average bars on a vertical bar chart?
Hey!

I've got a chart recording the root causes for various complaints lodged against my company over the past quarter.  I'm wondering how I can change the "Averages" vertical bars on the far right of the graph to horizontal lines overlaying the rest of the graph.

I know how to do it when there is only one average, however I'm not sure how when I want the average for "Human" to be a separate line from that of "Process" and so on.

Here is a screenshot of what I'm talking about: http://imgur.com/gallery/zReUk

Also, if anyone knows how to get rid of those annoying "root cause" repetitions on the X-axis that would be grand too.

Thanks!


-------------
Root cause is showing as a field because it is selected as a data field. Simply select it and delete it. Or right click that chart, choose select data and delete the field that way.

to lay horizontal lines, right click your chart and select Change Chart Type. On the menu that pops up select combo. Off to the rick you will see where you can select Bar or line.
