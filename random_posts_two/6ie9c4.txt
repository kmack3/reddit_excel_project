Why am I not able to vertically concatenate this set of data?
Hi, I have this formula for vertical concatenation, and it's worked in the past, but now it's not working for a new data set. 

I need to consolidate multiple rows into a single unique row--separated by employee ID.

Here's the formula I've been using, but it's not working. Anyone know why?

=IF(A2=A1,C2&", "&B2,B2) 

Never had a problem with it before, but now it's either just displaying zeros, or saying there are too many arguments to function properly. What's going on?

**EDIT:** Other error message: "Careful, we found one or more circular references in your workbook that might cause your formulas to calculate incorrectly."

How can this be, the data hasn't changed, nor has the formula or formatting...




-------------
Everything looks good syntax wise.

Double-check and make sure your system hasn't switch to using semicolons for argument separators, rather than commas?

When it says there's an error, what part of formula gets highlighted?

What cell is this formula going in?
-------------
I'm not seeing any highlighting, just the error message I just added in my edit

How can I do that check. Also, this is going into cell c2 and I need column b to concatenate. The unique identifier is an employee ID number in column A
-------------
If the formula you listed is going in Cell C2 then you've got a recursive argument in your formula. 
-------------
To check for arguments, when you start working on a formula, the little tool-tip appears showing what arguments are. Carefully look at that, to see what's being used to separate the arguments.

If this is going into C2, your formula (to prevent circular logic) should be:

    =IF(A2=A1,C1&", "&B2,B2)
