Command Button to copy data to second sheet
Looking for VBA code for Command Button to take values from "Data" sheet Column F5:F14 to "Pending" Sheet column E3:N3 via a button "Transfer Data". Once copied then delete values on "Data" sheet.

Thanks for all your help

    Option Explicit
    Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    
    Dim Rng1 As Range, Rng2 As Range
    
    Set Rng1 = Sheets("Data").Range("F5:F14")
    Set Rng2 = Sheets("Pending").Range("E3:N3")
    
    Rng2.Value = Rng1.Value
    Rng1.Value = vbNullString
    
    End Sub

This is great!  I'd like to add two more things if possible .. Click CommandButton1 it will add that new set of data to the next available row and also to copy B2 on Data to B3 on Pending.

Thanks again I really appreciate this!

I'm guessing you want B3 to find the next available row too? If not, change line 23 to Set Rng4 = .Range("B3")

    Option Explicit
    Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
    
    Dim lRow As Long
    Dim Rng1 As Range, Rng2 As Range
    Dim Rng3 As Range, Rng4 As Range
    Dim ws1 As Worksheet, ws2 As Worksheet
    
    Set ws1 = Worksheets("Data")
    Set ws2 = Worksheets("Pending")
    
    lRow = ws2.Cells(ws2.Rows.Count, 5).End(xlUp).Row + 1 'find next available row in Pending column E
    
    'set ranges
    
        With ws1
            Set Rng1 = .Range("F5:F14")
            Set Rng3 = .Range("B2")
        End With
    
        With ws2
            Set Rng2 = .Range(.Cells(lRow, 5), .Cells(lRow, 14))
            Set Rng4 = .Cells(lRow, 2)
        End With
    
    'copy and delete
    
        Rng2.Value = Rng1.Value   'copies Data values to Pending
        Rng4.Value = Rng3.Value   'copies B2 to B3
        Rng1.Value = vbNullString 'clears Data range
    
    End Sub
