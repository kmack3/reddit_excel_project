This code doesent run for integers 3,4 or 5?
When i choose i = 2 it works perfectly. But if is choose other integers the code doesent run. Can anybody see the problem?

    Sub date_transf_bank()
    Dim y As Integer 'Search through rows for persons in ark 1
    Dim x As Integer 'Search through colms for person in ark 1
    Dim i As Integer 'Choose name to search from Database

    i = 3 'myRangeDatabase.Cells.Range.Count
    For x = 6 To 14
    For y = 1 To 407 'myRangeArk1.Cells.Rows.Count
    If Sheets("Ark1").Cells(y, x) = Sheets("Alle lande og 
    sponsorer").Cells(i, 23) Then
    MsgBox y
    Sheets("Alle lande og sponsorer").Cells(i, 20) = 
    Sheets("Ark1").Cells(y, 3) 'myRange.Cells(y, 1).Row
    End If
    Next y
    Next x
    End Sub



THanks in advance
