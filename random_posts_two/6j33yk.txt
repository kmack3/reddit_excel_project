SQL % Wildcard Replacement
I'm replacing some SQL code using Excel formulas; there is a part of the SQL code:

    Parameter LIKE '%STREAM%'

I want to replicate this; so I want a wildcard that can recognize any string of 0+ characters.  I tried the * like this:

    Parameter="*Stream*"

But this didn't return results that started with "Stream" - am I doing something wrong with the wildcard characters?

EDIT: for further context:

It's an if statement...there is more to it than this, but the basic function is:

    IF(A1="*Stream*","Stream","Other")

If A1 starts with "Stream" (for example "Streamline") it won't recognize that and return the "String" value; it will return the "Other" value.

EDIT2:

I've found that the * wildcard isn't even working in this instance?  With the IF statement above, even if the cell contains "stream" it will always return other.  I think it's taking the literal for * instead of the wildcard character?


-------------
In what context?
-------------
Try    

    =IF(ISERROR(SEARCH("Stream",A1)),"Other","Stream")
-------------
This work for you?

    =IFERROR(IF(FIND("Stream",A1)>0,"Stream"),"Other")
-------------
I added more context in the main message.  Sorry that wasn't there first!
-------------
> =IF(ISERROR(SEARCH("Stream",A1)),"Other","Stream")

Thank you, this works.  I wish I didn't have to string 2 functions together just to replace that wildcard character but I suppose that's how Excel works.
