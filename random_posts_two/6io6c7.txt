Dividing By an Average for a Percentage
Hello r/excel

I'm essentially a beginner with Excel but I've created a spreadsheet to help me track production at work. Fiscally, some months consist of 4 weeks and some consist of 5 weeks. I have the average billing totaled for each week, then wish to average that (for a running month to date average) and divide it by what we pay our employees each week to get a payroll to billing percentage. The formula I use is:

=D132/(AVERAGE(H133:L133))

As you can see in the [picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/tQWzC), all 5 weeks are averaged, even if there is no value indicated yet. I was wondering if there was a way to only include the weeks that currently have a value so I can get an accurate month to date percentage as I update the sheet week to week.

I'd probably just have it do the averaging the long way so you can count just the weeks with numbers greater than zero:

    =D132/(SUM(H133:L133)/COUNTIF(H133:L133,">0"))

Edit: Oh actually I totally forgot there's an averageif function:

    =D132/AVERAGEIF(H133:L133,">0")
