Conditional formatting for if there is a range greater than X between two columns.
Good afternoon!  
Working on a big metrics report and I'm stuck on a formula. Columns are P and Q. Basically what I am trying to do is have the formula go "If P is 3 or more over Q, highlight both fields"  
Example: P has a value of 9, Q has a value of 5. The difference is 4, so I'd need to highlight the fields. I have tried several attempts (self taught..) with no luck. Any help is appreciated!

CF formula would be:

    =$P2-$Q2>=3

applied to a range of P2:Q100, or something like that.

Just tried and it didn't seem to work. I tried yours and "=AND($P223-$Q223>=3)" 223 because that's where my data starts. I selected both columns (headers included). Should I only be selecting one?  
Edit: Selected the full columns without the headers this time, used "=AND($P223-$Q223>=3)" and it worked. Thank you!
