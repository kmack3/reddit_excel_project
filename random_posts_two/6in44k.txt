How can I use custom shapes in an Excel scatterplot?
I created a scatterplot of data based on universities. How can I change the symbols to a unique symbol for each university? For example the Michigan point could be the Michigan logo and the Stanford point could be the Stanford logo. This would allow one to quickly compare the data points without a callout box labeling each point.

Right click on your data point (say Stanford in your example) and choose "Format Data Point". Under Series Option, you should see an option for "Fill". Select "Picture or texture fill" which will allow you to insert a picture from a file or from the internet.
