How to look up a random value in an array that meets certain criteria
Basically I have an array of numbers. I want to select a random one that is greater than 0. How could I do this?


-------------
So I'd have a column that's just assigning a random number to a row of data if it meets the criteria and displays nothing if it doesn't:

=if(value_cell>0,rand(),"")
 
Then we're going to search for a random value in  these random values we've just generated with a vlookup which isn't looking for exact matches so we'll always get something returned.

=vlookup(rand(),column_mentioned_above,value_cell,1)
