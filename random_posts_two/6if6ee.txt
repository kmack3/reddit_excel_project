Unable to scroll right using mouse pad in Excel Online
Hello. I cannot use two fingers to scroll right on my Chromebook in Excel Online, even though I could yesterday. Scrolling with two fingers to the right only scrolls down instead, and scrolls up when I attempt to scroll left. My colleagues using Macs on the same spreadsheet face the same issue. I have tried restarting computer and Excel Online and unfreezing and refreezing the cells. None of the forum suggestions I have found have worked. Can someone please help me out?

Scroll lock? Freeze pane?

I think this might be a hardware issue, not an excel issue.

Tried doing the freeze pane thing, I cannot get access to a keyboard to press the scroll lock key. Tried doing the virtual keyboard thing too but it doesn't show up.
