Validation check for 2 columns
I need to do a quality check to verify if column A has value in it then column B has a value as well. Column A has Dates and Column B has a numerical value between 1-4. Is there a way to create a report that would show the mismatches/error?



-------------
Something like:

    =IF(A1<>"",IF(B1="","Error - B is blank","OK - A and B have values"),"No value in A")

Put that in C1 (or if your data starts on a different row, change the row numbers appropriately) and copy down.  That should give a message against each row.  You can change the messages as needed.
