Informing users that a Function is still calculating.
So I have a couple of functions that pull in some variables, query a web service, and return the results of the web service query. Because it's a web service, sometimes it takes a few seconds for the query to recalculate/update its cell.

I tried to have the cell background turn yellow just before the actual query code executed, then back to no colour when the query returned, as a signal to users that the figure in that cell was in the process of changing. I've used that technique before when the code was structured as a SUB, but it doesn't work when it's a FUNCTION.

So, VBA coders of reddit, how do you indicate to your users that something is happening, and they should just wait a bit before recalculating?


-------------
How about changing the mouse cursor in your function to "Wait" (hourglass in earlier Windows) then back to normal immediately before ending?
    Function SlowCode()
    Application.Cursor = xlWait
    'slow code
    Application.Cursor = xlNormal
    SlowCode = result
    End Function



-------------
Could you drop your code to change the cell color into a sub and then call it at the start and end of the function?

You can updating the status bar in the lower left of the Excel window by using .StatusBar as follows:

    Application.StatusBar = "CALCULATING"

"CALCULATING" can be whatever text you want.  Make sure to reset it back to default after the function is done by using

    Application.StatusBar = False

Also a good, workable solution. More subtle than my giant orange text box, but intuitive. Can I award a clippy point to more than one person?

I'll give that a go, thanks!

Just tried that.. a little sub that changes the interior colour of the cells in question.. Adding in the call statements into the function breaks it. Sadly that's not an option.

So far the only visual signal that I seem to be able to give users that something is happening is a MsgBox - which isn't exactly a *good* signal.

I did that at first, but it was too subtle. If I'm going to use visual management, I want it to be really effective!

Do problems have more than one solution?

Can you call it before and after the function?
-------------
Continuing on the MsgBox line of thought, you could show a modeless form while the function is doing its thing. 

This is better than a message box because it neither interrupts the function nor the user's ability to continue working. In fact, the form can be dismissed and the code continues to run. 

Unfortunately, the form code cannot be used to modify the cell (I tried that).

Dear Doppelganger:

Just stopping by to make sure you're doing well. I'd call you a nerd for being on an excel sub, but I dice roll and would be calling the kettle black. I hope life is good and things are going well for you.

Twinsies!

Sincerely,

You, sort of.

The function isn't called, it's a UDF that I treat like a formula in the spreadsheet.

Still, I've had a few good suggestions that work.

You got me thinking... I've now got a textbox that appears when the function is calculating, and disappears when the function has updated. 

Thanks! Simple solutions are sometimes the ones I need the most help with...

Hey to you, my cop copycat buddy!  wow, up to 5, your mouth must taste like feet! :D :D  Hope you are well :)
