How to look up last value of column A and show value in the same row but in column B.
I have two columns A and B. The last value is A50, and I want to look up cell in B50. How do I do this? 

I have formula

    =(LOOKUP(2;1/(A:A<>"");A:A)) 

to find the last value, but I guess I have to add something more to find the cell next to the initial column.

You can just change the last values:

    =(LOOKUP(2;1/(A:A<>"");B:B)) 

does this work for you?

Interesting, I never thought to use lookup in that way.

Yes, it worked. Thank you!
