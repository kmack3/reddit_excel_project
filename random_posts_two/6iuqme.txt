Excel trick for separating First/Last names
Hey there,

I'm wondering if anyone knows a quick trick in excel to automatically sort a column with full name (first + last, separated by a space) into two separate columns (column 1: first name; column 2: last name)? 

Essentially, when i download data from an ad set I'm running on Facebook, the leads are delivered as both first and last in one single column, but I need to separate them out into two columns so they can be uploaded into our CRM. Is there an easy way to do this?

Thanks in advance :)

Full | First | Initial | last
---|---|----|----
John Doe | John || Doe
Mary Duncecap | Mary || Duncecap
Jane Donner | Jane || Donner
Frank Wiener | Frank || Wiener
Susan B. Anthony | Susan | B. | Anthony

If this is what you are looking for:

*Column B (for first name):*

=IFERROR(LEFT(A1,FIND(".",A1)-3),LEFT(A1,FIND(" ",A1)-1))


*Column C (for initial):*

=IFERROR(MID($A1,FIND(".",$A1)-1,2),"")

*Column D (for last name):*

=IFERROR(RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-FIND(" ",A1)),RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-FIND(" ",A1)))
