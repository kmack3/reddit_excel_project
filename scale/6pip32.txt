Very slow copy/paste time

I have a workbook I created that has suddenly started taking a very long time (30 min+) to change a formula by copying and pasting (alt-hvf) down.  There are ~45k rows, but that's not any bigger than I'm used to working with.  When I start a new workbook, and copy down the same formula, it pastes in seconds.

Here's the formula I'm trying to paste:
=IF(SUMIFS(M$1:M1,A$1:A1,A2)=0,IF(M2>Sheet1!$F$2,1,0),H1+1)

I'm replacing ">0" with the ">Sheet1!$F$2" term.  It's a simple counting formula, and I'm just trying to make the lower limit dynamic with the link.  I've tried a find and replace function, and I can see the cells changing in the cell name box, but i can almost count as fast as its moving through.

I've disable 'Enable Live Preview', 'Show Paste Options button', and 'Show Insert Options button'.  Doesn't seem to help.  Calculations are on manual.

I've copied and pasted down various columns a number of times, and am thinking it has something to do with the clipboard retaining all of that, but I can't figure it out.

Any direction would be appreciated.





-------------
Are there any other formulas in the workbook with volatile functions (INDIRECT, TODAY, NOW, OFFSET, etc.) that might be causing problems?

Try to adjust your nesting so the smaller formula calculates first:

    =IF(M2>Sheet1!$F$2,IF(SUMIFS(M$1:M1,A$1:A1,A2)=0,1, H1+1), 0)

nope

good thought.  i'll try that.  but i think the issue is the copy/paste itself.  (and delete as well.  highlighting the column and pressing the 'delete key' takes >10 mins before i kill it)

the workbook recalculates in 10 seconds
