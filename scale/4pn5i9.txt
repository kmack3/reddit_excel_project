Screen freezes when unfiltering ~3000 rows of data

Hello, I have a spreadsheet that I often filter in different ways and it works just fine with ~3000 rows. However, when I try to clear the filters, or select all on the filter, or make it a table, the screen freezes. The scroll marker on the sidebar still moves when I scroll, but nothing on the screen changes. I am not able to refilter, and saving, exiting, and going back in doesn't change anything. Any solutions?!

Try this, it's weird, but it seems to be a solution when Excel has its moments.

1. Save your document in binary format, "xlsb"

2. Close all instances of Excel, then open your new xlsb document.

3. If everything works properly, you can re-save the file as "xlsx" again.

Try Sorting the filtered column, then Unfilter.

This did not work. 

Thank you for the interesting solution though, haven't heard of this before! Will keep it in mind for future Excel 'moments.'

Did not work. I do have it filtered on multiple columns though. I've tried doing them one by one, and just through Filter > Clear. 

Also just to clarify, after the screen freezes, if I Undo, the data gets refiltered, and the screen becomes responsive again.

I do... I've tried pasting over the entire spreadsheet as values but that gives me an error message.

It seems to fix problems where Excel freezes or crashes, this sounded similar enough to warrant a try.

Yes.  My issue is that I cannot unfilter.
