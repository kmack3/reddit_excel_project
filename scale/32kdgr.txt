Counting Occurrences In A Large Data Set

I have a set of 32,939 email opens, 28,947 are duplicate IDs, and possibly triplicate and so on.  The column I have to identify individual opens is an eight digit ID.  Now I need to know, of those 28,947, which ID numbers are doubles, triples, and so on.  The data set is too large for a pivot table, and to large to do individual COUNTIF of each IDs, as there's probably 25K + of them.  Any ideas to show how many times each ID number is showing up?  


-------------
    ={SUM(1/COUNTIF(A1:A32939/A1:A32939))}

Entered as array formula
-------------
    Sub CountIDs()

    Dim d As Object, c As Range, k, tmp As String

    Set d = CreateObject("scripting.dictionary")
    For Each c In Selection
        tmp = Trim(c.Value)
        If Len(tmp) > 0 Then d(tmp) = d(tmp) + 1
    Next c

    For Each k In d.keys
        Debug.Print k, d(k)
    Next k

End Sub

Select the column that has your ID numbers. The results will display in the Immediate window.

Grab the column of iIDs, paste them onto a new sheet. 
Select Data, Remove Duplicates.
Then you can do a countif() next to the de-duped data.

Thanks for the help, I actually just ended up sorting by ID, breaking it down to 4 10K lists and making a pivot table on those 4 then combining the data.  It's a little neanderthal, but it looks like I need to learn more about COUNTIFs and Macros. 
-------------
I entered it as

=(SUM(1/COUNTIF(c1:c32939/c1:c32939)))

As C has the ID data and hit ctrl shift enter and was told it had too few arguments. 
-------------
How do I actually enter that in to an excel sheet?

Shoot, my bad. Meant to put:

    ={SUM(1/COUNTIF(A1:A32939,A1:A32939))}

Should be a "," in between those, not a "/"

It's a macro, so you'll have to display the Developer Tab. http://www.addintools.com/documents/excel/how-to-add-developer-tab.html

Then you'll create a new Macro named CountIDs, then paste it in and run it.

Ahhhh my world just became a bigger place...
