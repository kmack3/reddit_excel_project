What's the best way to cross-check two columns of values against each other (that won't crash Excel...)?

I need to send an email every-day to users who've taken a certain action. Right now, there's no automated way to make sure we're not emailing people we already emailed with this message, so I do it manually. 

Column A: People I've already emailed (~100k IDs right now)
Column B: People who should be emailed today  (~12k IDs per day)

Originally I was doing a simple conditional highlight for duplicate values, sorting column b by the highlighted values, and then removing those. What's left over in column b was my list. 

I used a macro (cross-check) but it runs too slow / crashes the window. Column A (those who have already received the email over the past few weeks) is about 100k values. 

In a few weeks this will be automated, but it's getting so slow these days that I'm not sure that doing it manually will continue to be an option.

I'd use the below, copy down for all cells in "B", then email those that are FALSE 

    =ISNUMBER(MATCH(B1,A:A,0))

Hi,  

Did you try MATCH? If it returns a number it is a duplicate else it is a unique ID. 
The formula in C2 would look like:  

    =MATCH(B2,$A$2:$A$100k,0). 

Then you drag it down. You can then filter out the names with numbers. If possible do this on a different sheet filtering 100k rows can be long...

Good luck

You're welcome, generally speaking if you have an heavy file all kind of conditional formatting will slow it down.
