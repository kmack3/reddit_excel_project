crash

Whenever I try to refresh connections, Excel crashes.

I have 30 connections that import text from separate web pages via the data/connections tab. I can refresh each connection by itself, or two at a time, but if I try to refresh more than two at a time, Excel crashes. Is there any way to refresh all data connections simultaneously without having Excel crash on me? Thanks!

Have you tried doing it another PC?

Can you refresh all 30 individually without problems?  If it isn't a specific import that is causing you to bomb, you might try saving the workbook in a compatibility format and trying again.

Yeah - I just emailed the file to myself and opened it on another computer. Same thing

Yeah, I can refresh all 30 individually. I'll try saving it in a compatibility format and get back to yip
