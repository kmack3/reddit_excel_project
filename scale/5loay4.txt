I found out that UDF and add-ins can prevent big xlsm files to be opened, but I don't get why.

So today I had to work on a big xlsm file, nearly 80mb with formulas and VBA inside.  
There was no way to open it, it was going in a loop:  
- content is unreadable;  
- do you want to recover it?  
- try 1;  
- try2 ...  
- ...  
I tried disabling the only add-in I was running (done by me, but it was basically silent: it take action on click of custom menu) and uninstalled some UDF...aaaannnnd magic, it took its time but Excel (2010) was finally able to open it.  
Why is it happening now?  I had this combination of UDF and add-in for months.    
Thank you for whatever idea you have :D

edit: I was able to narrow down the problem only to COM add-ins, xlam add-in (like UDFs ...) don't cause any problem.

~~80MB - seriously?,  what on earth have you got in there?~~

~~[The Bible](http://www.o-bible.com/dlb.html) is only 5MB~~

~~Excel.exe is only 25MB~~

~~Something is not right!~~

A few pivot tables on sizable data sets can do it pretty easily
