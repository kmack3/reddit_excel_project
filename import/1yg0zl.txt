Excel Querying Existing Access Database Going Slow

Hi everyone, I'm creating a Dashboard for my work and I'm running into this issue and was wondering if any body can help me :) There are roughly 4 millions rows of data (maybe 8-10 columns) in the Access file and here's my code, in summary:

Sub GetData_Click()

Dim cn As Object
    Dim rs As Object
    Dim strSql As String
    Dim strConnection As String
    Set cn = CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
    strConnection = "Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;" & _
        "Data Source=FILE LOCATION"
    strSql = "SQL Code"
    cn.Open strConnection
    Set rs = cn.Execute(strSql)
    
Worksheets("Dashboard").Range("A2").CopyFromRecordset rs

rs.Close
Set rs = Nothing
cn.Close
Set cn = Nothing

End Sub

The code always seem to get hung up at the Copyfromrecordset section. The same SQL code when I try to query within Access is instantaneous where as in Excel it takes up to minutes for the data to return. Thanks for all the help, I can provide more details as required. 


-------------
(Full disclosure, I've never used the CopyFromRecordset method, but I've done a lot of back and forth application queries) 

Two things come to mind possibly the *writing* to Excel is taking to long. Are you writing to and from two network locations? Watch your network traffic to see if it's bottlenecked.

The other is you're trying to do too much with a single query, or it isn't optimized. If it's a complex query with groups and where statements, break it into several smaller steps. Also see that your Where statements are working with indexes when possible.  

-------------
Try using power pivot instead of excel alone. Excel doesn't do well with massive data sets. (Sql is suppose to be fast because it's a database) Excel also only supports just over a million rows, and uses is quite CPU bound. (Other applications store a lot of the data as cache in RAM to call it up faster.) 

So you may need a faster computer as well.

Can you dump it to a fresh sheet without issue?  Are there a lot of complicated calculations present in the Excel sheet?
