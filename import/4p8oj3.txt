Big data merger

So I have 2800 spreadsheets of stock data. Is there a simple way where I can merge all of the spreadsheets? 


-------------
Can you convert to csv and just combine them all in order?

This seems like a better job for sql or powershell

I've used this in the past  to merge a coupe of hundred workbooks with single worksheets.

Pick one.


Being completely honest, Excel probably isn't it the correct tool when working with this amount of data. If you go into a little more detail about how you you want the final worksheet to look, I culd probably build a Python script for you to use.

What format are the spreadsheets in? If they are .csv you can use this approach below. I did this for approx. 190 csvs saved locally and it takes 30 seconds (to do 2800 of similar size and complexity it would take a little over 7 minutes). You'll have to customize the data merging loop (what columns, and where to copy) to your needs of course.

    Sub MergeCSVs()
    
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    
    Dim CSVPath
    Dim FS
    Dim file
    Dim wkb As Excel.Workbook
    Dim ResultsSheet As Worksheet
    Dim CSVUsed As Range
    Dim CSVRows As Integer
        
    Dim InputRow As Long
    InputRow = 3
    
    Set ResultsSheet = Sheets("Master List")
    ResultsSheet.Activate
    
    MsgBox ("The window will minimize in order to speed up execution." & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & _
            "Please do not alter files in Microsoft Office products while this process is running.")
    
    Application.WindowState = xlMinimized
    
    'Clear the results sheet
    ResultsSheet.Cells.Delete
    
    Set FS = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
    
    'The CSV files are stored in a subfolder of the folder where
    'this workbook is stored.

    CSVFolder = "\Subfolder name"
    CSVPath = ThisWorkbook.Path & CSVFolder
    
    If Not FS.FolderExists(CSVPath) Then
        MsgBox "Subfolder does not exist."
        Exit Sub
    End If
    
    ResultsSheet.Range("A2:D2").Value = Array("Client", "Name", "Disabled", "Display Name")
    ResultsSheet.Range("A2").EntireRow.Font.Bold = True
    For Each file In FS.GetFolder(CSVPath).Files
        If Right(file.Name, 3) = "csv" Then 'Only look at files with .csv extension
            Set wkb = Application.Workbooks.Open(file.Path)
            Set CSVUsed = wkb.Sheets(1).UsedRange
            CSVRows = CSVUsed.Rows.Count
                
            For x = 2 To CSVRows
                ResultsSheet.Cells(InputRow, 1) = Left(file.Name, Len(file.Name) - 4)
                ResultsSheet.Cells(InputRow, 2) = CSVUsed.Cells(x, 1)
                ResultsSheet.Cells(InputRow, 3) = CSVUsed.Cells(x, 2)
                ResultsSheet.Cells(InputRow, 4) = CSVUsed.Cells(x, 3)
                InputRow = InputRow + 1
            Next x
                
            wkb.Close False
    
        End If
    Next

End Sub

If you don't want to try a macro-driven approach you can try the Power Query add-in. You would select "from file -> from folder" to merge the contents of an entire folder.
