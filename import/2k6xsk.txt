Code to kill process or retry process after it stalls too long. Using this for webscraping when it freezes on connecting to web

I'm trying to webscrape about ~1000 webpages with unique urls. I have the code working correctly (pulls in a table, then Excel does work within its program to reorganize, then moves onto the next url).

It works until it decides to freeze on connecting to one of the urls. So then I kill excel, open it up, and start it right where it left off. Is there anyway to set a timer for my code that will see if a process is taking too long and ask it to try again?

Or maybe if someone is more familiar with web scraping, is it a problem with me trying to connect to too many websites without somehow closing each connection that overloads the program?

I'm using code similar to this form I found online

    Sub FetchData()
        With ActiveSheet.QueryTables.Add(Connection:= _
            "URL;http://www.zillow.com/homes/comps/67083361_zpid", Destination:=Range( _
            "$A$1"))
            .Name = "67083361_zpid"
            .FieldNames = True
            .RowNumbers = False
            .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
            .PreserveFormatting = True
            .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
            .BackgroundQuery = True
            .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
            .SavePassword = False
            .SaveData = True
            .AdjustColumnWidth = True
            .RefreshPeriod = 0
            .WebSelectionType = xlEntirePage
            .WebFormatting = xlWebFormattingNone
            .WebPreFormattedTextToColumns = True
            .WebConsecutiveDelimitersAsOne = True
            .WebSingleBlockTextImport = False
            .WebDisableDateRecognition = False
            .WebDisableRedirections = False
            .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
        End With
End Sub

Put a wait timer in between each connection to slow it down a bit? You are probably being throttled by the web server

I was just trying to do something similar yesterday. As part of a huge automation, I have Excel upload a file to Box, but on occasion the box server doesn't respond in time, or at all, causing a freeze- I was thinking of adding a timer and of it goes >x seconds, retry.

As a programmer who is new to this sub, and knows very little about excel, I just have to say that this doesn't fix the problem. It hides the problem, maybe. If a connection does end up blocking, he's still screwed. 

Is there not a way to add a timeout to the connection? I found a few things on google, but don't feel confident enough in my understanding to suggest anything.

+1 point.

You can use a  XMLHTTP object rather than the inbuilt webquery function. You can add a timeout loop into that.

            Set objHttp = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP")
            
            myURL = ""
            objHttp.Open "GET", myURL, False
            objHttp.send
            
            objHttp.waitForResponse    

Loop round the objHttp.waitForResponse  with a timer. You may be able to do the same with the webquery function but I'm not aware of any way
